		<h2 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h2>

		<p>Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of investigation and
		horror inspired by the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. In each
		game, one of the Ancient Ones, a being of unimaginable power
		that predates time itself, is awakening. Players take on the roles
		of investigators who are attempting to solve mysteries, defend
		humanity from unimaginable horrors, and ultimately banish
		the Ancient One from this world. If investigators fail at their
		task, the Ancient One awakens, and mankind is doomed.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="players-and-investigators">Players and Investigators</h3>

			<p>When playing Eldritch Horror, each player controls an
			investigator. In this rulebook, the word “investigator”
			refers to both the player controlling the investigator as
			well as the in-game character.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

		<p>Before playing each game, perform the following steps in order.</p>
		<h3 id="place-game-board">1. Place Game Board</h3>
		<p>Unfold the game board and place it in the center of the play
		area within easy reach of all players.</p>
		<h3 id="organize-tokens">2. Organize Tokens</h3>
		<p>Organize the following tokens as listed below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Create the Gate stack by randomizing the nine Gate tokens,
				and placing them facedown (common side up) in a stack
				within reach of all players.</li>
			<li> Create the Clue pool by placing the Clue tokens facedown
				(common side up) in a pile within reach of all players and
				randomize them.</li>
			<li> Create the general token pool by taking all Health, Sanity,
				Improvement, Travel Ticket, Eldritch, Mystery, and Rumor
				tokens and place them in piles within reach of all players.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3 id="choose-and-place-investigators">3. Choose and Place Investigators</h3>
		<p>Players agree upon one player to receive the Lead Investigator
		token. If they cannot decide, players assign this token to a
		random player as they see fit (for example, by rolling a die).
		Starting with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise,
		each player chooses one investigator. He takes the corresponding
		Investigator sheet, then places the matching Investigator token on
		the game board space listed on the back of his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<h3 id="receive-starting-possessions-health-and-sanity">4. Receive Starting Possessions, Health, and Sanity</h3>
		<p>Each investigator receives the starting possessions listed on the back
		of his Investigator sheet. He gains any Assets or
		Spells listed by taking the matching card from the game box.
		Then he takes a number of <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</a> tokens equal to
		his investigator’s maximum Health and Sanity listed on the
		front of his Investigator sheet. He places these tokens near his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<h3 id="determine-ancient-one">5. Determine Ancient One</h3>
		<p>As a group, players choose one of the Ancient One sheets. Each
		Ancient One provides a different game experience. For their first
		game, it is recommended players choose “Azathoth,” as he is the
		most straightforward Ancient One. Place the chosen sheet faceup
		(displaying a Doom value in the top
		left corner) near the game board and
		<strong>resolve any setup effects on the sheet</strong>.
		<h3 id="create-monster-cup">6. Create Monster Cup</h3>
		<p>Take all non-epic Monster tokens and place them in an opaque
		container such as a bowl, mug, or the cover of the game box
		(not shown in setup diagram). Then shake this container to
		randomize the Monster tokens.
		<p><strong>Do not place the <a href="#epic-monsters">Epic Monster</a> tokens in the Monster cup</strong>.
		Epic Monster tokens are marked by their red color and clipped
		lower-left corner.
		<h3 id="separate-and-place-decks">7. Separate and Place Decks</h3>
		<p>Take all Research Encounter cards, Special Encounter cards,
		and Mystery cards that do not correspond to the chosen
		Ancient One and return them to the game box (see diagram
		below). Those cards will not be used for this game.

		<section>
			<h3 id="ancient-one-specific-cards">Ancient One Specific Cards</h3>
			<p>Each Ancient One has two unique decks of cards: the
			Mystery deck and the Research deck. Some Ancient Ones
			also have a Special Encounter deck called out in their
			setup effect. Each card can be identified by an illustration
			of its corresponding Ancient One on the card’s back.</p>
		</section>

		<p>Then separate all other cards as listed below and place them
		near the game board.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shuffle all Expedition Encounter cards into a single deck,
				regardless of card back.</li>
			<li>Shuffle the Spell cards and Condition cards into two
				separate decks. Place these decks faceup, with the top
				card’s name and artwork visible.</li>
			<li>Set the Mythos cards aside for step 8. Then separate all
				other cards into decks by card back and shuffle each deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="build-mythos-deck">8. Build Mythos Deck</h3>

		<p>During step 8 of setup, players build the Mythos deck.
		The Mythos deck is built differently each game, based on the
		instructions on the bottom of the Ancient One sheet. To build this deck,
		perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Separate all Mythos cards into three piles, based upon
				the color on the front of the card (green, yellow, and
				blue). Shuffle each separately, and place them facedown.</li>
			<li>Build stage I of the Mythos deck by taking random
				cards of the denoted colors and quantities (listed at the
				bottom of the Ancient One sheet) and shuffling them
				together. Do not look at the cards at this time.</li>
			<li>Then build stage II of the Mythos deck (following the
				same steps as stage I) and place it <strong>under</strong> the stage I deck.</li>
			<li>Finally, build stage III of the Mythos deck and place
				it <strong>under</strong> the stage II deck to create a single Mythos
				deck. Once created, <strong>do not shuffle this deck</strong>. Place the
				deck near the Ancient One sheet. Return all remaining
				Mythos cards to the game box without looking at them.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="resolve-starting-effects">9. Resolve Starting Effects</h3>
		<p>Resolve the following effects to complete setup:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the Reference card that corresponds to
				the number of players near the Mythos deck.
				Players use the Reference card when resolving
				Mythos effects. Return all other Reference
				cards to the game box.</li>
			<li>Place the Doom token on the space of the
				Doom track listed on the upper-left corner of
				the Ancient One sheet. For example, the
				Azathoth sheet denotes that the Doom token
				starts on the “15” space of the Doom track.</li>
			<li>Place the Omen token on the green (comet)
				space of the Omen track.</li>
			<li>Place the top four cards of the Asset deck faceup in the four
				slots of the reserve (at the bottom-left of the game board).</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Gates indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Gate, take the top Gate token from the Gate
				stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
				Gate token. Then draw one random Monster token from
				the Monster cup and place it on the same space.</li>
			<li>Place the Active Expedition token on the space that
				corresponds to the illustration on the back of the top card
				of the Expedition Encounter deck.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Clues indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Clue, take one random Clue token from the
				Clue pool and place it facedown on the space indicated on
				the face of the Clue token.</li>
			<li>Finally, draw one Mystery card and place it near the Ancient
				One sheet. Then resolve any “When this card enters play”
				effects on that card.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
		<p>Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game. All players are on the
		same team and <a href="#winning-the-game">win or lose</a> the game together. The investigators’
		ultimate goal is to banish the Ancient One from this world by
		solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p>In addition, investigators need to deal with many threats and
		crises facing the world. These appear in the form of Gates
		(which spawn Monsters and can awaken the Ancient One) and
		<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards (which harm investigators and can end
		the game prematurely).</p>

		<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
		<p>Eldritch Horror is played over a series of game rounds. Each
		round consists of three phases that are resolved in the following
		order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Action Phase:</strong> Investigators perform actions to move about
				the game board and prepare for the tasks ahead.</li>
			<li><strong>Encounter Phase:</strong> Investigators fight Monsters or resolve
				encounter cards on their current space.</li>
			<li><strong>Mythos Phase:</strong> The Lead Investigator resolves one Mythos
				card. These cards often advance the Doom token, spawn
				Gates, or raise other challenges that investigators will need
				to overcome.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>At the end of each Mythos Phase, the Lead Investigator may
		pass the Lead Investigator token to any player of his choice.
		Investigators then start a new game round beginning with the
		Action Phase. Players continue resolving game rounds until
		they have won or lost the game.</p>
		<p>The back of the reference guide contains a quick reference of
		these phases.</p>

		<h2 id="phase-action-phase">Phase 1: Action Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, each investigator resolves up to two actions.
		Performing actions is the main way in which investigators move
		about the game board and acquire beneficial cards and tokens
		(such as Asset cards and travel tickets).</p>
		<p>This phase starts with the Lead Investigator. He performs two
		actions of his choice, then the investigator to his left performs
		two actions, and so on, until each investigator has performed
		his actions.</p>
		<p>During the Action Phase, investigators may perform the
		following actions. The detailed rules for these actions are
		explained in the following sections.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Travel</li>
			<li>Rest</li>
			<li>Trade</li>
			<li>Prepare for Travel</li>
			<li>Acquire Assets</li>
			<li>Component Actions</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Important:</strong> Each investigator can perform each action <strong>only
			once</strong> during a round. For example, an investigator cannot
		perform two Rest actions.</p>

		<h3 id="travel-action">Travel Action</h3>
		<p>The investigator moves his Investigator token to any adjacent
		space.</p>
		<p>After moving, the investigator may spend any number of
		travel tickets to move one additional space per ticket spent.
		Investigators can only spend Train Tickets to move along Train
		paths, and Ship Tickets to move along Ship paths. See the “Action Phase Example”
		diagram on page 8 for an example of a Travel action.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-spaces-and-paths">What are Spaces and Paths?</h3>
			<p>The different types of spaces and paths are shown on the
			“Legend” on the game board.</p>
			<p>Tokens are often placed on spaces of the game board.
			Spaces include named locations (such as “Arkham”), as
			well as numbered locations.</p>

			<p>Each space is connected to at least one adjacent space by
			lines known as paths.</p>
			<p>Each path has a type (color) that corresponds to a type
			of travel ticket.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="rest-action">Rest Action</h3>
		<p>The investigator recovers 1 Health and 1 Sanity (see “Health
		and Sanity” on page 14).</p>
		<p>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> perform this action if there is a Monster
		on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="trade-action">Trade Action</h3>
		<p>The investigator may trade possessions (Assets, Artifacts, Clues,
		Spells, and travel tickets) with another investigator on his space.</p>
		<h3 id="prepare-for-travel-action">Prepare for Travel Action</h3>
		<p>If the investigator is <strong>on a City space</strong>, he gains one travel ticket
		of his choice. The investigator cannot gain a Train Ticket unless
		there is at least one Train path connected to his space. Likewise,
		he cannot gain a Ship Ticket unless there is at least one Ship
		path connected to his space.</p>
		<p>If a player ever has more than two travel tickets, he must choose
		two to keep and discard the rest.</p>


		<h3 id="acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets Action</h3>
		<p>If the investigator is <strong>on a City space</strong>, he may attempt to
		acquire Asset cards from the reserve. He tests his Influence
		(]) by rolling dice and gains Assets of his choice from the
		reserve with total value equal to or less than the number of
		successes rolled (see “Tests” on page 12).</p>
		<p>If he does not gain any cards, the investigator may discard one
		card of his choice from the reserve.</p>
		<p>After performing an Acquire Assets action, replace any cards
		discarded or gained from the reserve by drawing replacement
		cards from the Asset deck.</p>
		<p>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> perform this action if there is a Monster
		on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="component-actions">Component Actions</h3>
		<p>The investigator may perform an action listed on one of his
		components (such as a card or his Investigator sheet). These
		actions are preceded by the word “Action” in bold.</p>
		<p>Although an investigator cannot perform a component action
		from a single component more than once each round, he can
		perform component actions of different components.</p>
		<p>Example: Lily Chen uses the action ability printed on her
		Investigator sheet. Then, for her second action, she could perform
		an action printed on an Asset card she has.</p>
		<p>An investigator may also perform some actions using
		components held by other investigators on his space. These
		actions are preceded by the phrase “Local Action” in bold.</p>


		<section>
			<h3 id="action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on San Francisco at the start of the Action
					Phase. Since he has the Lead Investigator token, Silas
					resolves his two actions first.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s first action, he performs a Travel action. He
					moves from San Francisco to space 5.</li>
				<li>During his Travel action, he decides to spend his Train
					Ticket to move one additional space along the Train
					path to Arkham.</li>
				<li><p>For Silas’s second action, he decides to perform a Rest
					action to recover 1 Health and 1 Sanity. Since he already
					has Sanity tokens equal to his maximum Sanity, he only
					recovers the 1 Health. He takes 1 Health from the token
					pool and places it by his Investigator sheet.</p>
					<p>Silas has performed his two actions. The investigator to
					his left may now perform two actions.</p></li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<h2 id="phase-encounter-phase">Phase 2: Encounter Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, each investigator resolves <strong>one encounter</strong>.
		Encounters often involve reading a short narrative on an
		encounter card which can have positive and/or negative effects.</p>
		<p>This phase starts with the Lead Investigator. He resolves
		an encounter, then the investigator to his left resolves an
		encounter, and so on, until each investigator has resolved
		one encounter.</p>
		<p>During the Encounter Phase, if an investigator is on a space
		containing one or more Monsters, he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single
		Combat Encounter against each Monster on that space, one at a
		time, in the order of his choice. If there are zero Monsters on an
		investigator’s space, he instead resolves a location encounter or a
		token encounter of his choice as described in the sections below.</p>
		<h3 id="combat-encounters-phase">Combat Encounters</h3>
		<p>If an investigator is on a space containing one or more Monsters,
		he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single Combat Encounter against each
		Monster on that space, one at a time, in the order of his choice.
		Combat Encounters are described in detail on page 14.</p>
		<p>After an investigator resolves all Combat Encounters, if there are
		no Monsters in his space, <strong>he may resolve another encounter</strong>.</p>
		<h3 id="location-encounters">Location Encounters</h3>
		<p>The investigator draws an encounter card matching his space’s
		artwork or from the General Encounter deck. He resolves the
		effect that matches his current space, then discards the card.</p>
		<p>If an investigator has multiple types of encounter cards that he
		could draw, he chooses which deck to draw from.</p>
		<p>Example: An investigator is on Arkham. He can choose to draw
		a card from either the General Encounter deck or the America
		Encounter deck. If he chooses to draw a General Encounter card,
		he then resolves the “City” portion of the card.</p>
		<p>The text below each named space
		on the game board lists the most
		common effect found on its specific
		encounter cards.</p>
		<h3 id="token-encounters">Token Encounters</h3>
		<p>Some tokens are placed on spaces of the game board and provide
		additional encounter options for investigators on that space.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Clue tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve
				Research Encounter cards.</li>
			<li>Gate tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve Other
				World Encounter cards.</li>
			<li>The Active Expedition token allows investigators to draw
				and resolve Expedition Encounter cards.</li>
			<li>Rumor tokens allow investigators to resolve the encounter
				listed on the <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card that refers to that space.</li>
			<li>Defeated Investigator tokens allow investigators to resolve
				the encounter listed on the back of the defeated investigator’s
				sheet (see “Defeated Investigators” on page 14).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="phase-mythos-phase">Phase 3: Mythos Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, the Lead Investigator draws the top card of
		the Mythos deck. There are seven possible effects on a Mythos
		card, and the Lead Investigator resolves them <strong>in the order they
			appear</strong> (left to right, starting from the top). The order and
		effects of each element are listed below:</p>
		<section>
			<h3 id="advance-omen">Advance Omen</h3>
			<p>Move the Omen token one space clockwise
			around the track. Then <strong>advance Doom</strong> by
			one for each Gate on the game board that
			matches the Omen token’s current space (see
			“What are the Doom and Omen Tracks?”)</p>
			<h3 id="resolve-reckoning-effects">Resolve Reckoning Effects</h3>
			<p>Resolve all effects proceeded by a @ icon
			on components in play. These components
			are marked with a red reckoning icon in the
			lower-right corner as a visual reminder.</p>
			<p>Resolve these effects in the following order:
			Monsters, Ancient One sheet, ongoing
			Mythos cards, and lastly investigator
			possessions and Conditions.</p>
			<h3 id="spawn-gates">Spawn Gates</h3>
			<p>Spawn a number of Gates as defined by the
			Reference card (see “Spawning Gates” on
			the right).</p>
			<h3 id="monster-surge">Monster Surge</h3>
			<p>At <strong>each gate</strong> that matches the Omen
			token’s current space, spawn the number of
			Monsters listed on the Reference card
			(see “Spawning Monsters” on page 11).
			If there are no matching Gates currently on
			the game board, spawn one Gate instead.</p>
			<h3 id="spawn-clues">Spawn Clues</h3>
			<p>Spawn a number of Clues as defined by the
			Reference card (see “Spawning Clues” on
			page 11).</p>
			<h3 id="place-rumor-token">Place Rumor Token</h3>
			<p>Place a Rumor token on the space listed (see
			“Rumors” on page 16).</p>
			<h3 id="place-eldritch-tokens">Place Eldritch Tokens</h3>
			<p>Place the listed number of Eldritch tokens
			on this Mythos card.</p>
			<h3 id="resolve-effect">Resolve Effect</h3>
			<p>If the card has the Event trait listed above
			the text effect, immediately resolve the
			effect and then discard the card. If it has
			the ongoing trait, place it in play near the
			Ancient One sheet. It remains in play until
			discarded by a game effect.</p>
		</section>
		<p>Investigators <strong>resolve only the effects displayed on the current
			Mythos card</strong>. For example, if the Mythos card does not have the
		spawn clues icon, investigators do not resolve the spawn clues step.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">What are the Doom and Omen Tracks?</h3>
			<p>The Doom track measures the time remaining until the
			Ancient One awakens (see page 16). When Doom
			advances, move the Doom token <strong>toward</strong> the “0” space of
			the Doom track. When Doom retreats, move the Doom
			token <strong>away from</strong> the “0” space of the Doom track.</p>
			<p>The omen track’s purpose is to advance Doom. When
			the Omen token advances, investigators advance Doom
			by 1 for each Gate on the game board that matches the
			current Omen symbol.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-gates">Spawning Gates</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Gate, take the top Gate token from
		the Gate stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
		Gate token.</p>
		<p>When a Gate is spawned, <strong>a Monster is spawned on the same
			space</strong> (see “Spawning Monsters” on page 11).</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-gates">What are Gates?</h3>
			<p>Gate tokens represent tears in the fabric of reality. These
			gateways can lead to other worlds, dimensions, or even
			points in time. These dangerous anomalies allow deadly
			powers into our world, such as Monsters and eventually
			even the Ancient Ones.</p>
			<p>Gates are the main way that Doom advances (see the
			“Advance Omen” step of the Mythos Phase). To prevent
			Doom from advancing (and the Ancient One from
			awakening), investigators need to resolve Other World
			Encounter cards to close (discard) Gates.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-monsters">Spawning Monsters</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Monster, draw one random Monster
		token from the Monster cup and place it on the space indicated
		by the effect.</p>
		<p>If the Monster has the spawn icon, look at the
		back of the Monster token and resolve its effect
		immediately after spawning it (for example,
		“When this Monster is spawned, move it to
		Heart of Africa”).</p>
		<h3 id="what-is-the-monster-cup">What is the Monster Cup?</h3>
		<p>During setup, players choose any opaque container,
		such as the game box lid, to serve as the Monster
		cup. When a Monster is spawned, one player draws a
		random Monster token from the Monster cup without
		looking. When a Monster is defeated or discarded,
		return it to the Monster cup. Then shake the container
		to randomize the Monster tokens.</p>
		<h3 id="spawning-clues">Spawning Clues</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Clue, take one random Clue token
		from the Clue pool and place it facedown on the space
		indicated on the Clue token.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-clues">What are Clues?</h3>
			<p>Clue tokens represent secrets and lore about the Ancient
			One. Investigators can collect these tokens by resolving
			Research Encounters (see page 9).</p>
			<p>Investigators use Clues to solve Mysteries (see page
			16), solve Rumors (see page 16), and to reroll dice
			during tests (see page 12).</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="winning-the-game">Winning the Game</h2>
		<p>Investigators immediately win the game if they solve three
		of the Ancient One’s Mysteries. If the Ancient One awakens,
		investigators will also need to solve the Final Mystery in order
		to win the game (see page 16).</p>
		<p>Investigators <strong>lose the game</strong> if any of the following occur:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the <strong>Doom</strong> token reaches the “0” space of the Doom
				track, the Ancient One awakens. The back of the Ancient
				One sheet lists how investigators can lose the game (see
				“The Ancient One Awakens” on page 16).</li>
			<li>All investigators have been <strong>eliminated</strong> from the game.</li>
			<li>A card effect causes investigators to lose the game. This
				most frequently appears on some <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards.</li>
			<li>The investigators are required to draw a Mythos card but
				cannot because the <strong>Mythos deck is empty</strong>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
		<p>Many effects require investigators to resolve a test. To resolve a
		test, the investigator rolls dice to determine whether he passes
		or fails the test. Passing tests often provides benefits to the
		investigator, while failing tests often have negative side effects.</p>
		<p>To resolve a test, the investigator <strong>rolls a number of dice
			equal to his value in the listed skill</strong>, taking into account any
		effects that add or subtract from his skill. Investigators roll <strong>a
			minimum of 1 die</strong> on each test.</p>
		<p>If he rolls <strong>at least one</strong> success (a “5” or a “6”), he passes the
		test. If he does not roll any successes, he fails the test. The
		number of successes rolled is called the test result.</p>
		<p>When an investigator passes or fails a test, he follows the
		original effect’s instructions for the matching result.</p>
		<p>Example: Lily Chen has an “Arcane Tome” Asset card which reads:
		“When you perform a Rest action, you may test [. If you pass,
		gain 1 Spell.” When resting, Lily resolves this test using her Lore
		([) of 2. She rolls 2 dice with results of “1” and “3.” Since she
		did not roll a “5” or “6,” she fails the test does not gain a Spell.</p>
		<p>An investigator can use only one card effect that provides a skill
		bonus during each test (for example, an Asset that reads “Gain
		+1 [”). If he has multiple card effects that provide a bonus, he
		uses <strong>the highest bonus</strong>.</p>
		<h3 id="tests-on-cards">Tests on Cards</h3>
		<p>On many cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
		embedded in parenthesis following a short narrative. When an
		investigator is resolving an effect that includes a skill icon in the
		text, he must immediately test that skill. The test declaration
		may also indicate a modifier (such as “–1”), which causes the
		investigator to roll more or fewer dice in the test.</p>
		<p>Note that most gameplay terms are capitalized on cards to help
		differentiate them from narrative text.</p>
		<h3 id="rerolling-dice">Rerolling Dice</h3>
		<p>Immediately after rolling dice during a test, an investigator
		may spend a Clue token to reroll one die. He may perform this
		multiple times, as long as he spends a Clue token each time. He
		determines whether he passed or failed after resolving all rerolls.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-skills">What are Skills?</h3>
			<p>Each investigator has five different skills listed on the
			bottom of his Investigator sheet. The number below
			each skill is the number of dice the investigator rolls
			when resolving a test (see “Tests” to the left).</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="improvement-tokens">Improvement Tokens</h3>
		<p>These tokens represent an investigator’s training
		in particular skills. When an effect allows an
		investigator to improve a skill, he gains an
		Improvement token with the matching icon and
		places it below his Investigator sheet with the “+1” side up.
		If he improves that skill a second time, he flips that token to
		the “+2” side. An investigator’s skill is equal to the value printed
		on his sheet plus the value of the matching Improvement token.</p>
		<h3 id="complex-encounters">Complex Encounters</h3>
		<p>Expedition Encounters, Other World Encounters, and Special
		Encounters are rewarding but dangerous adventures called
		complex encounters. Each of these cards has three effects. To
		resolve these encounters, an investigator first resolves the initial
		effect (the top box of the card). Depending upon the result of
		this effect, he immediately resolves <strong>one</strong> of the other two effects.</p>
		<p>If he passes the test in the initial effect, he resolves the card’s
		pass effect. If he fails the test, he resolves the card’s fail effect.
		He resolves the entire effect in the appropriate box (which may
		involve additional tests), then discards the card.</p>
		<p>If an Other World Encounter card instructs an investigator to
		“close this Gate,” he discards the Gate token from his space.</p>
		<p>After resolving an Expedition Encounter, the investigator
		moves the Active Expedition token to the space that matches
		the newly-revealed top card of the Expedition Encounter deck.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="other-world-encounter-example">Other World Encounter Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on a space containing a Gate token
					during the Encounter Phase.</li>
				<li>He decides to encounter the Gate, and draws a card
					from the Other World Encounter deck. He resolves
					the initial effect, and comes upon “(|–1).” This
					means that he needs to test his Observation.</li>
				<li>He takes his investigator’s skill in Observation (3)
					and applies the test’s modifier (–1).</li>
				<li>He does not have any abilities or possessions that
					further modify this value, so he rolls 2 dice.</li>
				<li>He did not roll a “5” or “6” and, therefore, fails
					the test. He resolves the fail effect that causes him
					to lose 3 Sanity unless he spends 1 Clue. He then
					discards the Other World Encounter card.</li>
		</section>

		<h2 id="gaining-possessions-and-conditions">Gaining Possessions and Conditions</h2>
		<p>Investigators frequently gain Assets, Artifacts, Spells, and
		Conditions. When an investigator gains a card or token, he
		places it faceup near his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<h3 id="spells-and-conditions">Spells and Conditions</h3>
		<p>Spell and Condition cards are unique in that they have hidden
		information on the back of their cards. When a player gains a Spell
		or Condition card, he can <strong>only look at the front</strong> of the card.
		<p>The card describes when an investigator flips it, at which point
		he immediately resolves the back of the card.</p>
		<h2 id="delayed-investigators">Delayed Investigators</h2>
		<p>Investigators can become Delayed by various effects. A Delayed
		investigator cannot perform actions.</p>
		<p>When an investigator becomes Delayed, he tips his Investigator
		token on its side to remember that he is Delayed. Instead of
		performing actions during the Action Phase, he stands up his
		Investigator token and is no longer Delayed.</p>

		<h2 id="health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</h2>
		<p>Each investigator starts the game with Health and Sanity
		tokens equal to his maximum Health and Sanity, respectively.</p>
		<p>When an effect causes an investigator to lose Health or Sanity,
		he discards Health or Sanity tokens from his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>If an investigator recovers Health or Sanity, he gains Health
		and Sanity tokens from the token pool. An investigator cannot
		have more Health or Sanity than his maximum.</p>
		<h3 id="defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>When an investigator has zero Health or Sanity, he is
		immediately defeated and resolves the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Advance Doom:</strong> Advance Doom by 1.
				<li><strong>Relocation:</strong> Move the Investigator token to the nearest
					City space. Then lay the Investigator token on its side and
					place a Health token on it to indicate the investigator has
					lost all Health, or place a Sanity token on it to indicate the
					investigator has lost all Sanity.</li>
				<li><strong>Collect Possessions:</strong> The investigator discards all Condition
					cards, Health, Sanity, and Improvement tokens and places
					his possessions (Assets, Artifacts, Spells, Clues, and travel
					tickets) on his Investigator sheet. He places the sheet and
					possessions out of the way; they will be needed if an
					investigator encounters this defeated investigator.</li>
				<li><strong>Pass Lead Investigator:</strong> If the defeated investigator has
					the Lead Investigator token, he must pass the token to an
					investigator of his choice.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>After resolving the steps above, investigators continue resolving
		the current phase of the game.</p>
		<h3 id="choosing-a-new-investigator">Choosing a New Investigator</h3>
		<p>If an investigator is defeated, the player controlling that
		investigator chooses a new investigator at the end of the Mythos
		Phase. To choose a new investigator, he <strong>chooses any unused
			Investigator and follows steps 3-4 of setup on page 4</strong>.</p>

		<h3 id="encountering-defeated-investigators">Encountering Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>Investigators may encounter a defeated investigator’s token in
		order to retrieve its possessions and possibly retreat doom.</p>
		<p>If an investigator is on the same space as a defeated
		investigator’s token during the encounter phase, he may resolve
		one of the encounters on the back of the defeated investigator’s
		sheet. He resolves the “Crippled” encounter if the Investigator
		token has a Health token on it or the “Insane” encounter if the
		Investigator token has a Sanity token on it.</p>
		<p>After resolving this encounter, remove the defeated Investigator
		token and Investigator sheet from the game. That investigator
		cannot be used for the remainder of the game.</p>
		<h3 id="devoured-investigators">Devoured Investigators</h3>
		<p>Some game effects cause investigators to be devoured. When
		an investigator is devoured, he is considered defeated but only
		follows steps <strong>1 and 4</strong> of “Defeated Investigators” on the left.
		He then discards all Conditions, possessions, Health, Sanity,
		and Improvement tokens and removes his Investigator sheet
		and token from the game. At the end of the Mythos Phase, he
		chooses a new investigator as described on the left.</p>
		<h2 id="combat-encounters">Combat Encounters</h2>
		<p>Resolving Combat Encounters is the main way in which
		investigators can defeat Monsters to remove them from the
		game board.</p>
		<p>When encountering a Monster, the investigator flips the
		Monster token facedown and reads the information on the
		back of the token. He then resolves two tests, first a will
		test and then a strength test, to determine the result of the
		Combat Encounter.</p>

		<h3 id="will-test">Will Test</h3>
		<p>The investigator resolves the Will ({) test listed on the
		Monster token.</p>
		<p>If the Monster’s horror is <strong>greater than</strong> the number of
		successes rolled (“5”s and “6”s), the investigator loses Sanity
		equal to the difference (see “Combat Example” below).</p>
		<h3 id="strength-test">Strength Test</h3>
		<p>The investigator resolves the Strength (}) test listed on the
		Monster token.</p>
		<p>If the Monster’s damage is <strong>greater than</strong> the number of
		successes rolled, the investigator loses Health equal to the
		difference (see “Combat Example” below).</p>
		<p>The Monster loses Health equal to the number of successes
		rolled. Indicate this by placing Health tokens on the Monster
		token. When a Monster has lost Health equal to or greater than
		its toughness, the Monster is defeated and returned to the
		Monster cup.</p>
		<p>If the investigator did not defeat the Monster, it remains on his
		space along with any Health tokens on it.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="combat-example">Combat Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>During the Encounter Phase, Lily Chen is on the same
					space as a Monster and must encounter it in combat.</li>
				<li>Lily flips the Monster token over. It does not have any
					effects that are resolved during combat.</li>
				<li>Lily resolves a { test. She has a { of 3. The Monster
					does not list a modifier, so she rolls 3 dice.</li>
				<li>She rolls 1 success and subtracts it from the Monster’s
					horror ( ) of 2. She loses 1 Sanity (equal to the
					difference).</li>
				<li>Lily resolves a } test. She has a } of 4. She applies
					the Monster’s modifier (–1) and gains a bonus from her
					“.38 Revolver” (+2), so she rolls 5 dice.</li>
				<li>She rolls 1 success, and subtracts it from the Monster’s
					damage ( ) of 1. Since she rolled a number of successes
					equal to its damage, she does not lose any Health.
					Since she rolled 1 success, the Monster loses 1 Health.
					She places 1 Health token on the Monster. Its toughness
					is 2, so it is not defeated and her encounter ends.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<h2 id="epic-monsters">Epic Monsters</h2>
		<p>Some Monsters are so powerful or
		unmanageable that they are immune to
		some effects. Epic Monsters are treated like
		Monsters for all effects except that they
		cannot be moved, discarded, or returned to
		the Monster cup.</p>
		<p>An Epic Monster cannot be defeated unless it has lost Health equal
		to its toughness, at which point it is returned to the game box.</p>
		<p>Epic Monsters are spawned by specific effects that call them out
		by name and are never placed in the Monster cup.</p>
		<h2 id="ambush">Ambush</h2>
		<p>Some effects cause investigators to encounter Monsters that
		are not on the game board. When an effect says “A Monster
		ambushes you,” the investigator draws one random Monster
		from the Monster cup and immediately encounters it in
		combat. After resolving combat, he returns the Monster to
		the Monster cup (even if he did not defeat it) and continues
		resolving the effect that caused the ambush.</p>

		<h2 id="rumors">Rumors</h2>
		<p><span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards often place Rumor
		tokens on specific spaces of the game board.
		An investigator on a space containing a Rumor
		token can encounter the token during the
		Encounter Phase. To do so, he resolves the
		effect on that Mythos card instead of resolving
		an encounter card.</p>
		<p>When a Mythos card is “solved,” discard the card along with
		any tokens on it, then discard the corresponding Rumor token
		from the game board.</p>
		<section>
			<h3 id="how-do-you-determine-a-random-space">How do you Determine a Random Space?</h3>
			<p>Some effects found on <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards and
			Mysteries place tokens on a “random space.” Whenever
			an effect refers to a random space, that space is
			determined by drawing one Clue token from the Clue
			pool and using the space indicated by the back of the
			token. The drawn Clue token is then discarded.</p>
		</section>
		<h2 id="mysteries">Mysteries</h2>
		<p>In order to win the game, investigators need to solve three
		Mysteries. Each Ancient One has its own deck of Mystery cards
		with a unique set of tasks that the investigators must resolve.</p>
		<p>During setup, draw one Mystery card and place it faceup next
		to the Ancient One sheet. Each card lists how investigators can
		solve that Mystery. As soon as a Mystery is solved, immediately
		draw a new Mystery card from the deck and place it faceup <strong>on
			top of</strong> the old Mystery card.</p>
		<p>As soon as three Mysteries are solved, investigators win the
		game. If the Ancient One awakens, investigators need to solve
		the Final Mystery in addition to three Mystery cards (see “Final
		Mystery” on the right).</p>

		<h2 id="the-ancient-one-awakens">The Ancient One Awakens</h2>
		<p>When the Doom token reaches the “0” space of the Doom
		track, the Ancient One awakens. Flip the Ancient One sheet and
		immediately resolve the “Awakens” effects (if any) on the upper-
		left corner of the sheet. This sheet remains facedown for the rest
		of the game, and its effects replace those found on the front of the
		sheet (including Cultist information). The back of the Ancient
		One sheet also describes how the investigators can lose the game.</p>
		<h3 id="eliminated-players">Eliminated Players</h3>
		<p>After the Ancient One has awakened, when an investigator is
		defeated or devoured, the player controlling that investigator is
		eliminated. Eliminated players do not select a new investigator
		to control and can no longer participate in the game.</p>
		<p>If all players are eliminated, investigators lose the game.</p>
		<h3 id="final-mystery">Final Mystery</h3>
		<p>Once the Ancient One awakens, it is much more difficult
		for investigators to win the game. Each Ancient One sheet
		describes one <span class="def">Final Mystery</span> the investigators must solve in
		order to win the game, usually confronting the Ancient One
		head-on.</p>
