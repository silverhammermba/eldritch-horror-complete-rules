		<h2 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h2>

		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is a cooperative game of investigation and
		horror inspired by the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. In each
		game, one of the Ancient Ones, a being of unimaginable power
		that predates time itself, is awakening. Players take on the roles
		of investigators who are attempting to solve mysteries, defend
		humanity from unimaginable horrors, and ultimately banish
		the Ancient One from this world. If investigators fail at their
		task, the Ancient One awakens, and mankind is doomed.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="players-and-investigators">Players and Investigators</h3>

			<p>When playing <em>Eldritch Horror</em>, each player controls an
			investigator. The word “investigator” refers to a player, the in-game character he controls,
and that character’s Investigator sheet and Investigator token. </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3 id="the-golden-rules">The Golden Rules</h3>
<p>Effects on components (such as cards) sometimes contradict
this rulebook. In this
situation, the component’s effect overrules this rulebook.</p>
<p>Restrictive effects on cards are absolute. For example, an
investigator’s Detained Condition says, “You <strong>cannot</strong> move.” That
investigator cannot move or be moved by any action or effect.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

		<p>Before playing each game, perform the following steps in order.</p>
		<h3 id="place-game-board">1. Place Game Board</h3>
		<p>Unfold the game board and place it in the center of the play
		area within easy reach of all players.</p>
		<h3 id="organize-tokens">2. Organize Tokens</h3>
		<p>Organize the following tokens as listed below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create the <a href="#what-are-gates">Gate</a> stack by randomizing the nine Gate tokens,
				and placing them facedown (common side up) in a stack
				within reach of all players.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Gates are kept facedown in the Gate stack until they are spawned.</li>
				<li>When a Gate is closed, it is discarded.</li>
						<li>When a Gate is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard pile
near the Gate stack until the Gate stack is empty. When there are
no Gates remaining in the Gate stack, place all discarded Gates
facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them.</li>
			</ul>
			<li id="clue-pool">Create the <a href="#what-are-clues">Clue</a> pool by placing the Clue tokens facedown
				(common side up) in a pile within reach of all players and
				randomize them.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Clues are kept facedown in the Clue pool until they are spawned,
					discarded, or gained by investigators.</li>
<li>When a Clue token is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard
pile near the Clue pool until the Clue pool is empty. When there
are no Clue tokens remaining in the Clue pool, place all discarded
Clue tokens facedown in the Clue pool and randomize them.</li>
<li>When an effect spawns a Clue, draw one random Clue token from
the Clue pool and place it on the space indicated on the front of
that token.</li>
<li>When an effect spawns a Clue on a specific space, draw one Clue
token from the Clue pool and place it on the space specified by the
effect. The space indicated on the front of the Clue token is not
referenced.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Create the general token pool by taking all Health, Sanity,
				Improvement, Travel Ticket, Eldritch, Mystery, and Rumor
				tokens and place them in piles within reach of all players. These tokens are always
available. If the general token pool has no remaining tokens of any one type,
track those tokens on paper or with a small object such as a coin.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Eldritch tokens are a generic resource used by many effects,
					including the Ancient One.</li>
				<li>A component that places an Eldritch token on the game board
					describes how investigators interact with that token.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<h3 id="choose-and-place-investigators">3. Choose and Place Investigators</h3>
		<p>Players agree upon one player to receive the Lead Investigator
		token. If they cannot decide, players assign this token to a
		random player as they see fit (for example, by rolling a die).
		Starting with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise,
		each player chooses one investigator. He takes the corresponding
		Investigator sheet, then places the matching Investigator token on
		the game board space listed on the back of his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Each Investigator sheet has an action ability that the investigator
may perform during the Action Phase and a passive ability that
affect how he and other investigators interact with the game.</li>
<li>Each Investigator sheet lists the investigator’s maximum Health
and Sanity and five skills: Lore ([), Influence (]),
Observation (|), Strength (}), and Will ({).</li>
<li><p>The back of each Investigator sheet indicates the investigator’s
starting location, including a map for reference, and his starting
possessions, Conditions, and effects.</p>
	<p>It also indicates the investigator’s defeated investigator encounters,
	including a Crippled effect and an Insane effect.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="receive-starting-possessions-health-and-sanity">4. Receive Starting Possessions, Health, and Sanity</h3>
		<p>Each investigator receives the starting possessions listed on the back
		of his Investigator sheet. He gains any Assets or
		Spells listed by taking the matching card from the game box.
		Then he takes a number of <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</a> tokens equal to
		his investigator’s maximum Health and Sanity listed on the
		front of his Investigator sheet. He places these tokens near his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<h3 id="determine-ancient-one">5. Determine Ancient One</h3>
		<p>As a group, players choose one of the Ancient One sheets. Each
		Ancient One provides a different game experience. For their first
		game, it is recommended players choose “Azathoth,” as he is the
		most straightforward Ancient One. Place the chosen sheet faceup
		(displaying a <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">Doom</a> value in the top
		left corner) near the game board and
		<strong>resolve any setup effects on the sheet</strong>.

		<ul>
			<li>The chosen Ancient One sheet determines the
				Ancient One for the entire game.</li>
<li>The Ancient One’s illustration is featured on the back of the
	<a href="#special-encounters">Special Encounters</a>, <a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounters</a>, and <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a> that
correspond to it.</li>
<li>The Ancient One’s effects may set aside Monster tokens or other
	components.</li>
<li>The Ancient One sheet defines the specific information of <a href="#cultists">Cultist</a>
	Monsters.</li>
<li>When the Ancient One <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">awakens</a>, flip the sheet and resolve its
	“awakens” effects, if any.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="create-monster-cup">6. Create <a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster Cup</a></h3>
		<p>Take all non-epic, non-set-aside Monster tokens and place them in an opaque
		container such as a bowl, mug, or the cover of the game box
		(not shown in setup diagram). Then shake this container to
		randomize the Monster tokens.
		<p><strong>Do not place the <a href="#epic-monsters">Epic Monster</a> tokens in the Monster cup</strong>.
		Epic Monster tokens are marked by their red color and clipped
		lower-left corner.
		<h3 id="separate-and-place-decks">7. Separate and Place Decks</h3>
		<p>Take all Research Encounter cards, Special Encounter cards,
		and Mystery cards that do not correspond to the chosen
		Ancient One and return them to the game box. Those cards will not be used for this game.

		<section>
			<h3 id="ancient-one-specific-cards">Ancient One Specific Cards</h3>
			<p>Each Ancient One has at least two unique decks of cards: the
			Mystery deck and the Research deck. Some Ancient Ones
			also have Special Encounter decks called out in their
			setup effect.</p>
			<p id="special-encounters">The illustrations on the back of each Special Encounter indicates
the Ancient One and the Mystery or Final Mystery it corresponds
to. Special Encounter cards also share their title with the Mystery
or Final Mystery they correspond to.</p>
			<p>The instructions for resolving Special Encounters are defined by the
			Ancient One sheet or Mystery cards.</p>
		</section>

		<p>Then separate all other cards as listed below and place them
		near the game board.</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="expedition-deck">Shuffle all <a href="#complex-encounters">Expedition</a> Encounter cards into a single deck,
				regardless of card back.</li>
			<li>Shuffle the Spell cards and Condition cards into two
				separate decks. Place these decks faceup, with the top
				card’s name and artwork visible.</li>
			<li>Set the Mythos cards aside for step 8. Then separate all
				other cards into decks by card back and shuffle each deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="build-mythos-deck">8. Build Mythos Deck</h3>

		<p>The Mythos deck is built differently each game, based on the
		instructions on the bottom of the Ancient One sheet. To build this deck,
		perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Separate all Mythos cards into three piles, based upon
				the color on the front of the card (green, yellow, and
				blue). Shuffle each separately, and place them facedown.</li>
			<li>Build stage I of the Mythos deck by taking random
				cards of the denoted colors and quantities (listed at the
				bottom of the Ancient One sheet) and shuffling them
				together. Do not look at the cards at this time.</li>
			<li>Then build stage II of the Mythos deck (following the
				same steps as stage I) and place it <strong>under</strong> the stage I deck.</li>
			<li>Finally, build stage III of the Mythos deck and place
				it <strong>under</strong> the stage II deck to create a single Mythos
				deck. Once created, <strong>do not shuffle this deck</strong>. Place the
				deck near the Ancient One sheet. Return all remaining
				Mythos cards to the game box without looking at them.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="resolve-starting-effects">9. Resolve Starting Effects</h3>
		<p>Resolve the following effects to complete setup:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the Reference card that corresponds to
				the number of players near the Mythos deck.
				Players use the Reference card when resolving
				Mythos effects. Return all other Reference
				cards to the game box.</li>
			<li>Place the Doom token on the space of the
				Doom track listed on the upper-left corner of
				the Ancient One sheet. For example, the
				Azathoth sheet denotes that the Doom token
				starts on the “15” space of the Doom track.</li>
			<li>Place the Omen token on the green (comet)
				space of the Omen track.</li>
			<li id="reserve">Place the top four cards of the Asset deck faceup in the four
				slots of the reserve (at the bottom-left of the game board). Whenever a card is gained or discarded from the reserve, the active
investigator places the top card from the Asset deck faceup in its
place except during an <a href="#acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets</a> action.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Gates indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Gate, take the top Gate token from the Gate
				stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
				Gate token. Then draw one random Monster token from
				the Monster cup and place it on the same space.</li>
			<li>Place the Active Expedition token on the space that
				corresponds to the illustration on the back of the top card
				of the Expedition Encounter deck. If the top
card of the Expedition Encounter deck changes for any reason, move the token to the
appropriate space.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Clues indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Clue, take one random Clue token from the
				Clue pool and place it facedown on the space indicated on
				the face of the Clue token.</li>
			<li>Finally, draw one Mystery card and place it near the Ancient
				One sheet. Then resolve any “When this card enters play”
				effects on that card.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="hidden-information">Hidden Information</h2>
		<p>Some information is intentionally hidden from players. The following
cannot be examined by players unless they are instructed by some
effect:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The back of <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided cards</a>, such as Spells or Conditions.</li>
			<li>The order and specific cards found in any deck.</li>
			<li>The front of Clues or Gates that are in the Clue pool or Gate stack.</li>
			<li>Mythos cards that have been returned to the game box.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Information that is not hidden includes the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The back of Monster tokens.</li>
	<li>The cards in discard piles.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Investigator sheets.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Ancient One sheets.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Clue tokens that are in the discard pile or held by an investigator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although players may legally look at this information, they may find
the game more exciting if they do not look at this information unless
instructed by some effect. </p>

		<h2 id="set-aside">Set Aside</h2>

		<p>During setup, some components might be set aside. Keep these
		components near the Ancient One sheet.</p>
		<ul>
<li>Cards that have been set aside are separated by card back, shuffled,
	and placed face down next to the Ancient One sheet.</li>
<li>When a component that was set aside during setup is discarded, it
is not returned to the deck or pool like other components of that
type. Instead, it is set aside again.</li>
<li>Components that are set aside cannot be used except by effects
that specifically name them. For example, a Monster token that
has been set aside cannot be spawned except by an effect that
specifically names that token.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is a cooperative game. All players are on the
		same team and <a href="#winning-the-game">win or lose</a> the game together. The investigators’
		ultimate goal is to banish the Ancient One from this world by
		solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p>In addition, investigators need to deal with many threats and
		crises facing the world. These appear in the form of Gates
		(which spawn Monsters and can awaken the Ancient One) and
		<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards (which harm investigators and can end
		the game prematurely).</p>

		<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is played over a series of game rounds. Each
		round consists of three phases that are resolved in the following
		order:</p>
		<ol id="lead-investigator">
			<li><a href="#phase-action-phase"><strong>Action Phase:</strong></a> Investigators perform actions to move about
				the game board and prepare for the tasks ahead.</li>
			<li><a href="#phase-encounter-phase"><strong>Encounter Phase:</strong></a> Investigators fight Monsters or resolve
				encounter cards on their current space.</li>
			<li><a href="#phase-mythos-phase"><strong>Mythos Phase:</strong></a> The Lead Investigator resolves one Mythos
				card. These cards often advance the Doom token, spawn
				Gates, or raise other challenges that investigators will need
				to overcome.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The player who has the Lead Investigator token is referred to as the
“Lead Investigator” by cards and effects. At the end of each Mythos Phase, the Lead Investigator may
		pass the Lead Investigator token to any player of his choice.
		Investigators then start a new game round beginning with the
		Action Phase. Players continue resolving game rounds until
		they have won or lost the game.</p>

		<p><span class="def">Active investigator</span> refers to the investigator currently performing
actions or resolving an encounter. During the Mythos Phase, the
Lead Investigator is the active investigator.</p>

		<p>If multiple effects would be resolved at the same time during the game, the active
		investigator decides the order in which they are resolved.</p>
		<p>When investigators make a decision as a group, the Lead
		Investigator makes the final decision.</p>

		<h2 id="phase-action-phase">Phase 1: Action Phase</h2>
		<p>Performing actions is the main way in which investigators move
		about the game board and acquire beneficial cards and tokens
		(such as Asset cards and travel tickets).</p>
		<p>During the Action Phase, each investigator may perform up to two
		actions. The <a href="#lead-investigator">Lead Investigator</a> performs his two actions first, then
proceeding clockwise around the play area, each other investigator
performs his two actions.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Important:</strong> Each investigator can perform each action <strong>only
			once</strong> during a round. For example, an investigator cannot
		perform two Rest actions.</li>
		<li>If an investigator cannot or does not wish to perform an action, he
			may choose not to perform his action or actions.</li>
<li>An investigator must fully resolve an action before performing
another action. For example, he cannot interrupt a Travel action
with a Trade action, and then continue moving.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During the Action Phase, investigators may perform the
		following actions. The detailed rules for these actions are
		explained in the following sections.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#travel-action">Travel</a></li>
			<li><a href="#rest-action">Rest</a></li>
			<li><a href="#trade-action">Trade</a></li>

		<h3 id="travel-action">Travel Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator moves to any space adjacent to his current
		space. Then he may spend any number of <a href="#prepare-for-travel-action">travel tickets</a>, moving one
additional space along a Train path or Ship path for each Train Ticket
token or Ship Ticket token spent, respectively.
		The <a href="#action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</a>
		includes an example of a Travel action.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-spaces-and-paths">What are Spaces and Paths?</h3>
			<p>The different types of spaces and paths are shown on the
			“Legend” on the game board.</p>
			<p>Tokens are often placed on spaces of the game board.
			Spaces include named locations (such as “Arkham”), as
			well as numbered locations.</p>

			<p>Each space is connected to at least one other space by
			lines known as <span class="def">paths</span>. Two spaces are adjacent if they are connected by a single unbroken path.</p>
			<p>Train and Ship paths each correspond to a type of travel ticket.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="rest-action">Rest Action</h3>
		<p>The investigator recovers 1 <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health</a> and 1 <a href="#health-and-sanity">Sanity</a>.</p>
		<p>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> perform this action if there is a Monster
		on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="trade-action">Trade Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator can trade any number of <a href="#possessions">possessions</a> with
another investigator on his space. The two investigators may freely give
any number of possessions to the other, as long as both investigators
agree to this trade.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Condition cards, Health tokens, Sanity tokens, and Improvement
				tokens cannot be traded.</li>
			<li>Investigators cannot trade with <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated</a> investigators.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="prepare-for-travel-action">Prepare for Travel Action</h3>
		<p>If the investigator is <strong>on a City space</strong>, he gains one travel ticket
		of his choice. The investigator cannot gain a Train Ticket unless
		there is at least one Train path connected to his space. Likewise,
		he cannot gain a Ship Ticket unless there is at least one Ship
		path connected to his space.</p>
		<p>An investigator cannot have more than two travel tickets. If he
already has two travel tickets when he would gain a new one, he may
discard one travel ticket before gaining the new travel ticket.</p>


		<h3 id="acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator <strong>on a City space</strong> <a href="#tests">tests</a> ]. Then he may
		gain any number of cards from the <a href="#reserve">reserve</a> with total <span class="def">value</span> (the number in the upper-left corner) equal to or
less than the test result.
<ul>
	<li>If he is unable or chooses not to gain any cards from the reserve, he
		may instead discard one card of his choice from the reserve.</li>
	<li>An investigator on a space containing a Monster <strong>cannot</strong> perform
	this action.</li>
</ul>

		<h4 id="bank-loan">Bank Loan</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator performs an Acquire Assets action, he may
gain a Debt Condition to immediately add 2 successes to his test
result.</li>
<li>If an investigator already has a Debt Condition, he cannot acquire
	a Bank Loan.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>After completely resolving an Acquire Assets action, replace any cards
		discarded or gained from the reserve by drawing replacement
		cards from the Asset deck.</p>

		<p>Related Topics: <a href="#gaining-possessions-and-conditions">Gaining Possessions and Conditions</a></p>


		<h3 id="component-actions">Component Actions</h3>
		<p>The investigator may perform an action listed on one of his
		components (such as Investigator sheets, Conditions, and <a href="#possessions">possessions</a>). These
		actions are preceded by the word “Action” in bold.</p>

		<p>Like all actions, each component action can only be performed
once per round. Although an investigator cannot perform a component action
		from a single component more than once each round, he can
		perform component actions of different components. Multiple investigators <strong>cannot</strong> perform the same
		action on one component during a single round, except for <a href="#local-action">local
			actions</a>. For example, if an investigator uses a component action
on an Asset and then trades it to another investigator, the new
owner cannot use the component action that round.</p>

		<p class="example">Example: Lily Chen uses the action ability printed on her
		Investigator sheet. Then, for her second action, she could perform
		an action printed on an Asset card she has.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>An action ability on an Investigator sheet can be performed only
				by that investigator.</li>
			<li>An action ability on a possession or Condition can be performed
				only by the investigator who has the card.</li>
			<li id="local-action">An investigator may also perform some actions using
				components held by other investigators on his space. These
				actions are preceded by the phrase “Local Action” in bold. An investigator may perform local actions on his own possessions
and Conditions. Multiple investigators may perform the same local action during the
course of a single Action Phase.</li>
		</ul>


		<section class="example">
			<h3 id="action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on San Francisco at the start of the Action
					Phase. Since he has the Lead Investigator token, Silas
					resolves his two actions first.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s first action, he performs a Travel action. He
					moves from San Francisco to space 5.</li>
				<li>During his Travel action, he decides to spend his Train
					Ticket to move one additional space along the Train
					path to Arkham.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s second action, he decides to perform a Rest
					action to recover 1 Health and 1 Sanity. Since he already
					has Sanity tokens equal to his maximum Sanity, he only
					recovers the 1 Health. He takes 1 Health from the token
					pool and places it by his Investigator sheet.</li>
			</ol>
<p>Silas has performed his two actions. The investigator to
					his left may now perform two actions.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="phase-encounter-phase">Phase 2: Encounter Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, each investigator must resolve <strong>one encounter</strong>.
		Encounters often involve reading a short narrative on an
		encounter card which can have positive and/or negative effects. We recommend a player other
than the active investigator reads encounter cards and does not reveal
the results of passing or failing a test that has not yet been resolved.</p>
		<p>The investigators resolve encounters in turn order starting
with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise around the play
area.</p>
		<p>During the Encounter Phase, if an investigator is on a space
		containing one or more Monsters, he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single
		Combat Encounter against each Monster on that space, one at a
		time, in the order of his choice. If there are zero Monsters on an
		investigator’s space, he instead resolves a location encounter or a
		token encounter of his choice as described in the sections below. If an investigator has the option of multiple encounters, he chooses
one.</p>

		<p>If an investigator has a Detained Condition card, he resolves the
back of his Condition card instead of resolving an encounter. He
does this <strong>even if</strong> there is a Monster on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="combat-encounters-phase">Combat Encounters</h3>

		<p>If an investigator is on a space containing one or more Monsters,
		he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single <a href="#combat-encounters">Combat Encounter</a> against each
		Monster on that space, one at a time, in the order of his choice.</p>
		<p>After an investigator resolves all Combat Encounters, if there are
		no Monsters in his space, <strong>he may resolve another encounter</strong>.</p>
		<h3 id="location-encounters">Location Encounters</h3>
		<p>The investigator draws an encounter card matching his space’s
		artwork or from the General Encounter deck. He resolves the
		effect that matches his current space, then discards the card. When an encounter deck is empty, immediately shuffle its discard pile
to form a new deck.</p>
		<p>If an investigator has multiple types of encounter cards that he
		could draw, he chooses which deck to draw from.</p>
		<p class="example">Example: An investigator is on Arkham. He can choose to draw
		a card from either the General Encounter deck or the America
		Encounter deck. If he chooses to draw a General Encounter card,
		he then resolves the “City” portion of the card.</p>
		<p>The text below some named spaces
		on the game board lists the most
		common effects found in those specific
		encounters.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator may encounter his
space by drawing a General Encounter card and resolving the
effect that corresponds to his space’s type.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Arkham, Buenos
Aires, or San Francisco may encounter that space by drawing an
America Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds
to his space’s name.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Istanbul,
London, or Rome may encounter that space by drawing a Europe
Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds to his
space’s name.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Shanghai, Sydney,
or Tokyo may encounter that space by drawing an Asia/Australia
Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds to his
space’s name.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="token-encounters">Token Encounters</h3>
		<p>Some tokens are placed on spaces of the game board and provide
		additional encounter options for investigators on that space.</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="research-encounters">Clue tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve
				Research Encounter cards.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>When a Research Encounter says, “this Clue,” it is referring to the
Clue being encountered.</li>
				<li>If the Clue token being encountered is not gained or discarded, it
					remains on its space and can be encountered again.</li>
				<li>When a Research Encounter says, “additional Clue,” it is referring
					to Clues in the Clue pool.</li>
			</ul>
			<li id="other-world-encounters">Gate tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve Other
				World Encounter cards.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>When an Other World Encounter says, “this Gate,” it is referring
					to the Gate being encountered.</li>
				<li>If an Other World Encounter card instructs an investigator to
					“close this Gate,” he discards the Gate token from his space.</li>
				<li>While an investigator is resolving an Other World Encounter, he is
still considered to be on his current space and is not removed from
the game board.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The Active Expedition token allows investigators to draw
				and resolve <a href="#expedition-deck">Expedition Encounter</a> cards.</li>
			<ul>
		<li>After resolving an Expedition Encounter, the investigator
		moves the Active Expedition token to the space that matches
		the newly-revealed top card of the Expedition Encounter deck.</li>

		<h2 id="phase-mythos-phase">Phase 3: Mythos Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, the Lead Investigator draws the top card of
		the Mythos deck. If the Mythos deck is empty, the discard pile is not shuffled into
the deck. Instead, if a Mythos card cannot be drawn, the Mythos
Phase ends and investigators lose the game.</p>

		<p>There are seven possible effects on a Mythos
		card, and the Lead Investigator resolves them <strong>in the order they
			appear</strong> (left to right, starting from the top). The order and
		effects of each element are listed below:</p>
		<section>
			<h3 id="advance-omen">Advance Omen</h3>
			<p>Move the Omen token one space clockwise
			around <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">the track</a>. Then <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks"><strong>advance Doom</strong></a> by
			one for each Gate on the game board that
			matches the Omen token’s current space.</p>
			<h3 id="resolve-reckoning-effects">Resolve Reckoning Effects</h3>
			<p>Resolve all effects proceeded by a @ icon
			on components in play. These components
			are marked with a red reckoning icon in the
			lower-right corner as a visual reminder.</p>
			<p>Resolve these effects in the following order:
			Monsters, Ancient One sheet, <span class="trait">Ongoing</span>
			Mythos cards, and lastly starting with the Lead Investigator
and proceeding clockwise, each investigator resolves the @ effect
on each possession and Condition he has, if any, in the order of his
choice.</p>
			<p>If a Mythos card has the icon on the lower-right corner, it is a
reminder that the card has a @ effect. That card does not cause
other @ effects to be resolved.</p>
			<p>If a Monster is spawned or an investigator gains a component
while investigators are resolving @ effects, they do not resolve the
@ effect on that Monster or component.</p>

			<h3 id="spawn-gates">Spawn Gates</h3>
			<p><a href="#spawning-gates">Spawn a number of Gates</a> as defined by the
			Reference card.</p>
			<h3 id="monster-surge">Monster Surge</h3>
			<p>At <strong>each gate</strong> that matches the Omen
			token’s current space, <a href="#spawning-monsters">spawn the number of
				Monsters</a> listed on the Reference card.
			If there are no matching Gates currently on
			the game board, spawn one Gate instead.</p>
			<h3 id="spawn-clues">Spawn Clues</h3>
			<p><a href="#spawning-clues">Spawn a number of Clues</a> as defined by the
			Reference card.</p>
			<h3 id="place-rumor-token">Place Rumor Token</h3>
			<p>Place a <a href="#rumors">Rumor</a> token on the space listed.</p>
			<h3 id="place-eldritch-tokens">Place Eldritch Tokens</h3>
			<p>Place the listed number of Eldritch tokens
			on this Mythos card.</p>
			<h3 id="resolve-effect">Resolve Effect</h3>
			<p>If the card has the <span class="trait">Event</span> trait listed above
			the text effect, immediately resolve the
			effect and then discard the card. If it has
			the <span class="trait">Ongoing</span> trait, place it in play near the
			Ancient One sheet. It remains in play until
			discarded by a game effect.</p>
		</section>
		<p>Investigators <strong>resolve only the effects displayed on the current
			Mythos card</strong>. For example, if the Mythos card does not have the
		spawn clues icon, investigators do not resolve the spawn clues step.</p>

		<section id="doom">
			<h3 id="what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">What are the Doom and Omen Tracks?</h3>
			<p>The <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">Ancient One awakens</a> when Doom reaches the “0” space of the <span class="def">Doom track</span>. When Doom
			<span class="def">advances</span>, move the Doom token <strong>toward</strong> the “0” space of
			the Doom track. If the Ancient One has not awoken, when Doom retreats, move the Doom
			token <strong>away from</strong> the “0” space of the Doom track.</p>
			<p>If an effect advances Doom beyond the “0” space, Doom advances
to 0, the Ancient One awakens, and then Doom continues to
advance using the Ancient One’s <a href="#awaken-doom">rules for advancing Doom</a>.</p>
			<p>The <span class="def">Omen track’s</span> purpose is to advance Doom. When the Omen advances, move the Omen token the indicated
number of spaces clockwise around the Omen track one space at a
time. For each space it enters, advance Doom by one for each Gate
on the game board that corresponds to the current Omen.</p>
			<p>The “current Omen” is the icon on the space of the Omen track
containing the Omen token.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-gates">Spawning Gates</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Gate, take the top Gate token from
		the Gate stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
		Gate token.</p>
		<p>When a Gate is spawned, <strong>a <a href="#spawning-monsters">Monster is spawned</a> on the same
			space</strong>.</p>
		<p>If an effect would spawn a Gate and the Gate stack and discard
		pile are empty, <strong>advance Doom by one instead</strong>.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-gates">What are Gates?</h3>
			<p>Gate tokens represent tears in the fabric of reality. These
			gateways can lead to other worlds, dimensions, or even
			points in time. These dangerous anomalies allow deadly
			powers into our world, such as Monsters and eventually
			even the Ancient Ones.</p>
			<p>Gates are the main way that Doom <a href="#advance-omen">advances</a>. To prevent
			Doom from advancing (and the Ancient One from
			awakening), investigators need to resolve <a href="#other-world-encounters">Other World
				Encounter</a> cards to close (discard) Gates.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-monsters">Spawning Monsters</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Monster, draw one random Monster
		token from the <a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster cup</a> and place it on the space indicated
		by the effect.</p>
		<p>If the Monster has the spawn icon, look at the
		back of the Monster token and resolve its effect
		immediately after spawning it (for example,
		“When this Monster is spawned, move it to
		Heart of Africa”).</p>
		<p>Monsters cannot be spawned from the Monster cup if the Monster
cup is empty. Set aside Monsters cannot be spawned if all set aside
Monsters of the named type are on the game board.</p>

		<h4 id="cultists">Cultists</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Unlike most Monsters, a Cultist Monster does not have
				information printed on the back of its Monster token.</li>
<li>When an investigator encounters a Cultist Monster, he references
the Cultist information on the Ancient One sheet. This includes
its { test, } test, horror, damage, toughness, and effects.</li>
<li>All Cultist Monsters have and icons printed on their fronts.
These icons remind players to check the Ancient One sheet, which
may list a “When this Monster is spawned,” or @ effect.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="what-is-the-monster-cup">What is the Monster Cup?</h3>
		<p>During setup, players choose any opaque container,
		such as the game box lid, to serve as the Monster
		cup. When a Monster is spawned, one player draws a
		random Monster token from the Monster cup without
		looking. When a Monster is defeated or discarded,
		return it to the Monster cup. Then shake the container
		to randomize the Monster tokens.</p>
		<h3 id="spawning-clues">Spawning Clues</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Clue, take one random Clue token
		from the Clue pool and place it facedown on the space
		indicated on the Clue token.</p>
		<p>Clues cannot be spawned or gained from the Clue pool if the Clue
		pool and discard pile are empty.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-clues">What are Clues?</h3>
			<p>Clue tokens represent secrets and lore about the Ancient
			One. Investigators can collect these tokens by resolving
			<a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounters</a>.</p>
			<p>Investigators use Clues to solve <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>, solve <a href="#rumors">Rumors</a>, and to reroll dice
			during <a href="#tests">tests</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="winning-the-game">Winning the Game</h2>
		<p>The game immediately ends when an effect specifies that
		“Investigators win the game,” or “Investigators lose the game.” In the
		rare circumstance that both of these effects happen at the same time,
		investigators win the game.</p>
		<p>Investigators win the game by solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a> as indicated on the front
		of the Ancient One sheet.</p>
		<p>Investigators <strong>lose the game</strong> if any of the following occur:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">Ancient One awakens</a>, the back of the Ancient
				One sheet lists how investigators can lose the game.</li>
			<li>All investigators have been <a href="#eliminated-players"><strong>eliminated</strong></a> from the game.</li>
			<li>A card effect causes investigators to lose the game. This
				most frequently appears on some <a href="#rumors"><span class="trait">Rumor</span></a> Mythos cards.</li>
			<li>The investigators are required to draw a Mythos card but
				cannot because the <strong>Mythos deck is empty</strong>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
		<p>Many effects require investigators to resolve a test, which involves
		rolling dice to determine whether he passes or fails the test. Passing
		tests often provides benefits to the investigator, while failing tests
		often have negative side effects. When an investigator resolves a test,
		he performs the following steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Determine Dice Pool:</strong> The investigator determines the number of
				dice he will roll. This number is his <span class="def">dice pool</span>.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>He starts with a number equal to the <a href="#what-are-skills">skill</a> being tested.</li>
				<li>He adds or subtracts the test modifier (the number that follows
					the skill icon on the effect).</li>
				<li>If he has an Improvement token for the skill being tested, he
					adds the Improvement token’s modifier.</li>
				<li>He may use <strong>one</strong> effect that provides a bonus (for example “Gain
					+3 {”). If multiple effects provide a bonus, he uses only <strong>the
						highest bonus</strong>.</li>
				<li>He adds any “additional dice” he gains from effects that apply.
					Additional dice are cumulative and are in addition to other
					effects.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> He rolls a number of dice equal to his dice pool.
				<ul>
					<li>If an investigator’s dice pool is below 1, he rolls 1 die instead.</li>
					<li>If an investigator’s dice pool is greater than the number of dice
						available, he rolls as many dice as possible, counts his successes,
						and rolls the dice again until he has rolled a number of dice
						equal to his dice pool.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>Determine Result:</strong> Each “5” or “6” rolled is one <span class="def">success</span>. The
					total number of successes rolled is the <span class="def">test result</span>. If he rolls
					at least one success, he passes the test. If he does not roll any
					successes, he <span class="def">fails</span> the test.</li>
				<li><strong>Resolve Pass or Fail Effect:</strong> The consequence of passing or failing
					the test is determined by the effect that triggered the test.</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Some effects specify only a pass effect or a fail effect. If an
				investigator passes a test that does not have a pass effect, there is no
				effect. Likewise, if an investigator fails a test that does not have a
				fail effect, he suffers no ill effects.</li>
			<li>On encounter cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
				embedded in the text in parentheses. The test declaration may also
				indicate a test modifier.</li>
			<li>Effects that are dependent on a test are always preceded by “if you
				pass,” or “if you fail.” Any effect in that sentence occurs only if you
				pass the test or fail the test, respectively. Any effect after the period
				or part of a new paragraph, is independent from previous effects.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="example">Example: Lily Chen has an “Arcane Tome” Asset card which reads:
		“When you perform a Rest action, you may test [. If you pass,
		gain 1 Spell.” When resting, Lily resolves this test using her Lore
		([) of 2. She rolls 2 dice with results of “1” and “3.” Since she
		did not roll a “5” or “6,” she fails the test does not gain a Spell.</p>

		<h3 id="tests-on-cards">Tests on Cards</h3>
		<p>On many cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
		embedded in parenthesis following a short narrative. When an
		investigator is resolving an effect that includes a skill icon in the
		text, he must immediately test that skill. The test declaration
		may also indicate a modifier (such as “–1”), which causes the
		investigator to roll more or fewer dice in the test.</p>
		<p>Note that most gameplay terms are capitalized on cards to help
		differentiate them from narrative text.</p>

		<h3 id="rerolling-dice">Rerolling Dice</h3>
		<p>Immediately after rolling dice during a test, an investigator
		may spend a Clue token to reroll one die.</p>
		<p>If multiple effects allow an investigator to reroll a die, he may
resolve each effect separately. There is no limit to the number of
times a die or test can be rerolled, so long as the investigator has
the means to do so. There is no limit to the number of Clues he can spend
to reroll dice.</p>
		<p>When a die is rerolled, use the result of the reroll, even if the new
		result is worse. He determines whether he passed or failed after resolving all rerolls.</p>

		<p>Most reroll effects (including spending Clue tokens) specifically
		reroll dice <strong>during a test</strong>. Such effects cannot be used on other die
rolls, such as the @ effect of a Blessed Condition card.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-skills">What are Skills?</h3>
			<p>Each investigator has five different skills listed on the
			bottom of his Investigator sheet. The number below
			each skill is the base number of dice the investigator rolls
			when resolving a <a href="#tests">test</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lore ([) is often tested when casting <a href="#spells">Spells</a> and resolving
					Other World Encounters.</li>
				<li>Influence (]) is often tested when performing the Acquire
					Assets action and resolving General Encounters on City spaces
					and Defeated Investigator Encounters.</li>
				<li>Observation (|) is often tested when resolving Research
					Encounters and Expedition Encounters.</li>
				<li>Strength (}) is often tested when resolving Combat
					Encounters and Expedition Encounters.</li>
				<li>Will ({) is often tested when resolving Combat Encounters and
					Other World Encounters.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<h3 id="improvement-tokens">Improvement Tokens</h3>
		<p>These tokens represent an investigator’s training
		in particular skills. When an effect allows an
		investigator to improve a skill, he gains an
		Improvement token with the matching icon and
		places it below his Investigator sheet with the “+1” side up.
		If he improves that skill a second time, he flips that token to
		the “+2” side. An investigator cannot improve a single skill more than twice. An investigator’s skill is equal to the value printed
		on his sheet plus the value of the matching Improvement token.</p>

		<h3 id="complex-encounters">Complex Encounters</h3>
		<p>Expedition Encounters, Other World Encounters, and Special
		Encounters are rewarding but dangerous adventures called
		complex encounters. Each of these cards has three effects. To
		resolve these encounters, an investigator first resolves the <span class="def">initial
			effect</span> (the top box of the card). Depending upon the result of
		this effect, he immediately resolves <strong>one</strong> of the other two effects.</p>
		<p>If he passes the <a href="#tests">test</a> in the initial effect, he resolves the card’s
		<span class="def">pass effect</span> in the middle of the card. If he fails the test, he resolves the card’s <span class="def">fail effect</span> at the bottom of the card.
		He resolves the entire effect in the appropriate box (which may
		involve additional tests), then discards the card.</p>

		<section class="example">
			<h3 id="other-world-encounter-example">Other World Encounter Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on a space containing a Gate token
					during the Encounter Phase.</li>
				<li>He decides to encounter the Gate, and draws a card
					from the Other World Encounter deck. He resolves
					the initial effect, and comes upon “(|–1).” This
					means that he needs to test his Observation.</li>
				<li>He takes his investigator’s skill in Observation (3)
					and applies the test’s modifier (–1).</li>
				<li>He does not have any abilities or possessions that
					further modify this value, so he rolls 2 dice.</li>
				<li>He did not roll a “5” or “6” and, therefore, fails
					the test. He resolves the fail effect that causes him
					to lose 3 Sanity unless he spends 1 Clue. He then
					discards the Other World Encounter card.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<h2 id="gaining-possessions-and-conditions">Gaining Possessions and Conditions</h2>
		<p>Investigators frequently gain Assets, Artifacts, <a href="#spells">Spells</a>, and
		Conditions. When an investigator gains a card or token, he
		places it faceup near his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>An investigator can gain a card or token only if it is available.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A card is available if it is in the deck, discard pile, or reserve.</li>
			<li>Cards and tokens on a <a href=#defeated-investigators">defeated investigator’s</a> sheet are not
available.</li>

			<li><strong>Gaining a Random Card:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator
				to gain a card (for example, “Gain 1 Artifact”). The investigator
				draws one card from the top of the deck matching the specified
				card type.</li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#double-sided-cards">Double-sided cards</a> are gained from the bottom of the deck.</li>
				<li>If an investigator gains a <a href="#spells">Spell</a> or Condition that he already has,
					he discards it and draws a replacement, repeating this process
					until he draws a card he does not already have (if able).</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Card with a Specific Trait:</strong> Some effects instruct an
				investigator to gain a card with a specific trait (for example, “Gain
				a <span class="trait">Madness</span> Condition”). The investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> that card type’s
				deck then discard pile for the first card matching the specified trait
				and gains that card. Then he shuffles the deck.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>An investigator that gains a <a href="#spells">Spell</a> or Condition in this way
					searches the deck for the first card matching the specified trait
					he does not already have and gains that card.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Specific Card:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator to
				gain a specific card by name (for example, “Gain an Axe Asset”).
				The investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> that card type’s deck then discard pile
				for the first card matching the specified name and gains that card.
				Then he shuffles the deck.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If the named card is in the reserve, the investigator gains that
					card instead.</li>
				<li>If the specified card cannot is not found while searching, he does
					not gain a card. For instance, if other investigators or defeated
					investigators possess all copies of the card or all copies of the
					card have been returned to the game box.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Card from the Reserve:</strong> Some effects instruct an
				investigator to gain a card (sometimes with a specific trait) from
				the reserve (for example “Gain 1 <span class="trait">Ally</span> Asset from the reserve”).
				The investigator gains one card <strong>of his choice</strong> that matches the
				specified trait from the reserve.</li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Clue:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator to gain a
				Clue. The investigator takes one random Clue token from the
				<a href="#clue-pool">Clue pool</a>, and places it near his Investigator sheet. When a
				<a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounter</a> card instructs the investigator to “gain this
				clue,” he gains the Clue token from his space.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="search">Search</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator searches for a card, he looks at cards from
the bottom of the deck until he finds a card that matches his
search criteria.</li>
<li>If an investigator does not find a card that matches his search
criteria while searching a deck, he then searches that deck’s
discard pile.</li>
<li>After a deck is searched, the investigator shuffles that deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="possessions">Possessions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>An investigator’s possessions include his Clue tokens, travel ticket
				tokens, Asset cards, Artifact cards, and <a href="#spells">Spell</a> cards.</li>
			<li>If an effect does not list a limit, it may be used only once per
instance of the triggered event. For example, if an Asset allows an
investigator to recover 1 additional Health when he performs a
Rest action, he may only use that effect once per Rest action.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="double-sided-cards">Double-Sided Cards</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Double-sided cards of the same type do not share a common back and instead have hidden
		information on the back of their cards.
				They can be identified by the card type under the card’s name.</li>
			<li>When a player gains a double-sided card, he can <strong>only
					look at the front</strong> of the card. The card describes
				when an investigator flips it, at which point
		he immediately resolves the back of the card. When a card is flipped to its front side, do not resolve the
effects on its front.</li>
<li>Decks of double-sided cards remain faceup. Investigators may look
	at the front of the top card of each deck of double-sided cards.</li>
<li>When an investigator draws a random card from a deck of double-
	sided cards, he draws the bottom card.</li>
<li>When a double-sided card is discarded, it is immediately shuffled
	back into its respective deck.</li>
<li>After a player shuffles a deck of double-sided cards, another player
	cuts the deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="spells">Spells</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Spell cards are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided</a>. An investigator <strong>cannot look at the
					back of Spell cards</strong> unless an effect allows him to.</li>
			<li>An investigator can resolve a Spell card’s effect as described on the
				card. A Spell card’s effect may be triggered by a specific event or
				require an action.</li>
			<li>When an investigator resolves a Spell card’s effect, he resolves the
				effects on the front of the card. This may include a test and/or
				flipping the card.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot have multiple copies of the same Spell card.
				If he gains a duplicate Spell card for any reason, he discards the
				newly-gained card.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Condition cards are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided</a>. An investigator <strong>cannot look at
					the back of Conditions</strong> unless an effect allows him to.</li>
<li>Conditions cannot be traded.</li>
<li>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> have multiple copies of the same
Condition. If he would gain a Condition that he already has a
copy of, he does not gain another copy of that Condition.</li>
<li>Some Conditions allow an investigator to perform unique actions
	as described on the card.</li>
<li>If a Condition’s effect does not list a limit, it may only be used
	once per instance of the triggered event.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="discarding">Discarding</h2>

		TODO is there value in centralizing this? How to link to this?

		<ul>
			<li>An investigator can discard only his own possessions and
				Condition cards.</li>
			<li>When an effect discards a token from the game board, the active
				investigator discards that token.</li>
			<li>Whenever a card is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard pile
				by its deck.</li>
			<li>Double-sided cards, such as Spells or Conditions, are immediately
				shuffled back into their respective decks when discarded.</li>
			<li>When an investigator searches a deck for a specific card and does not
				find the card he is looking for, he also searches that deck’s discard pile.</li>
			<li>When a deck of cards is empty, immediately shuffle its discard pile
				to form a new deck and have another player cut the deck. The Mythos deck is never replenished.</li>
			<li>When Clue tokens are discarded, they are placed in a faceup discard
				pile near the Clue pool. If there are no Clue tokens remaining in the
				Clue pool, place the Clue tokens from the discard pile facedown in
				the Clue pool and randomize them.</li>
			<li>When Gate tokens are discarded, they are placed in a faceup
				discard pile near the Gate stack. If there are no Gate tokens
				remaining in the Gate stack, place the Gate tokens from the
				discard pile facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them.</li>
			<li>When Monster tokens are discarded, they are returned to the
				Monster cup, and the cup is randomized.</li>
			<li>Monsters that have been set aside during setup are never returned
				to the Monster cup. Instead, they are set aside when discarded.</li>
			<li>All other tokens are returned to the token pool when discarded.</li>
			<li>If an effect forces an investigator to discard a component and he
				does not have enough of that component, he discards all of that
				component instead.</li>
			<li>Components that are not on the game board cannot be discarded
				from the game board. If an effect forces investigators to discard a
				component from the game board and there is not enough of that
				component on the board, they discard all of that
				component instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="spend">Spend</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator spends a token or card, such as a Clue token,
				he discards it in exchange for an effect.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot spend a token or card he does not have.</li>
			<li>An investigator may choose not to spend a token or card he has.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot spend Health or Sanity if doing so would
				cause him to be <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated</a> (i.e., he cannot spend his last Health
				or Sanity).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="delayed-investigators">Delayed Investigators</h2>
		<p>Investigators can become Delayed by various effects. A Delayed
		investigator cannot perform any actions.</p>
		<p>If an investigator would become Delayed on his turn during the Action
Phase, he immediately ends his action and loses all remaining
actions <strong>instead of becoming Delayed</strong>.</p>
		<p>When an investigator becomes Delayed, he tips his Investigator
		token on its side to remember that he is Delayed. Instead of
		performing actions during the Action Phase, he stands up his
		Investigator token and is no longer Delayed.</p>

		<h2 id="health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</h2>
		<p>Each investigator starts the game with Health and Sanity
		tokens equal to his maximum Health and Sanity, respectively.</p>
		<p>When an effect causes an investigator to lose Health or Sanity,
		he discards Health or Sanity tokens from his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>If an investigator <span class="def">recovers</span> Health or Sanity, he gains Health
		and Sanity tokens from the token pool. An investigator cannot
		have more Health or Sanity than his maximum.</p>
		<p>Health or Sanity tokens that are marked with a “3” represent three
single Health or Sanity tokens, respectively. Players may swap a “3”
token for three single tokens or three single tokens for a “3” token
at any time.</p>
		<p>Effects that prevent the loss of Health or Sanity cannot be used
		when an investigator <a href="#spend"><strong>spends</strong></a> Health or Sanity. An investigator cannot spend Health or Sanity if doing so would
cause him to be defeated (i.e., he cannot spend his last Health or
Sanity).</p>
		<h3 id="defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>When an investigator has zero <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health or Sanity</a>, he is
		immediately <span class="def">defeated</span>, stops resolving any encounter or action he is currently resolving, and resolves the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Advance Doom:</strong> Advance Doom by 1.
				<li><strong>Relocation:</strong> Move the Investigator token to the <a href="#nearest">nearest</a>
					City space. Then lay the Investigator token on its side and
					place a Health token on it to indicate the investigator has
					lost all Health, or place a Sanity token on it to indicate the
					investigator has lost all Sanity. If the investigator has lost all <strong>Health and Sanity</strong>, he chooses
either a Health token or a Sanity token to place on his
Investigator token.</li>
				<li><strong>Collect Possessions:</strong> The investigator discards all Condition
					cards, Health, Sanity, and Improvement tokens and places
					his <a href="#possessions">possessions</a> on his Investigator sheet. He places the sheet and
					possessions out of the way; they will be needed if an
					investigator encounters this defeated investigator.</li>
				<li><strong>Pass Lead Investigator:</strong> If the defeated investigator has
					the Lead Investigator token, he must pass the token to an
					investigator of his choice.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>A defeated investigator is not considered an investigator. A
defeated investigator cannot perform actions, resolve effects, or be
affected by effects that affect investigators.</p>
		<p>After resolving the steps above, investigators continue resolving
		the current phase of the game.</p>


		<h3 id="choosing-a-new-investigator">Choosing a New Investigator</h3>
		<p>If an investigator is defeated, the player controlling that
		investigator chooses a new investigator at the end of the Mythos
		Phase. To choose a new investigator, he <strong>chooses any unused
			Investigator and follows <a href="#choose-and-place-investigators">steps 3–4 of setup</a></strong>.
		A player may not
choose an investigator that has been previously defeated during the
same game. If the Ancient One has <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">awoken</a> or the player cannot choose a new investigator because
there are none available, he is <a href="#eliminated-players">eliminated</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="encountering-defeated-investigators">Encountering Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>Investigators may encounter a defeated investigator’s token in
		order to retrieve its possessions and possibly retreat doom.</p>
		<p>If an investigator is on the same space as a defeated
		investigator’s token during the encounter phase, he may resolve
		one of the encounters on the back of the defeated investigator’s
		sheet. He resolves the “Crippled” encounter if the Investigator
		token has a Health token on it or the “Insane” encounter if the
		Investigator token has a Sanity token on it.</p>
		<p>After resolving this encounter, remove the defeated Investigator
		token and Investigator sheet from the game. That investigator
		cannot be used for the remainder of the game.</p>
		<h3 id="devoured-investigators">Devoured Investigators</h3>
		<p>Some game effects cause investigators to be devoured. When
		an investigator is devoured, he is considered defeated but only
		follows steps <strong>1 and 4</strong> of <a href="#defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</a>.
		He then discards all Conditions, possessions, Health, Sanity,
		and Improvement tokens and returns his Investigator sheet
		and token to the game box. At the end of the Mythos Phase, he
		<a href="#choosing-a-new-investigator">chooses a new investigator</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="combat-encounters">Combat Encounters</h2>

		<p>Resolving Combat Encounters is the main way in which
		investigators can defeat <a href="#spawning-monsters">Monsters</a> to remove them from the
		game board.</p>

		<p>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on a space containing
one or more Monsters must encounter each Monster on his space, one
at a time, in the order of his choice. An investigator resolves a Combat
Encounter by following these steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Check Monster Effects:</strong> The Monster might have effects that alter how
				the investigator resolves the combat. Flip the
				Monster token facedown and read the information on the
				back of the token before resolving any other part of the Combat Encounter.</li>
			<li><strong>Resolve Will Test:</strong> The investigator resolves the Will ({) <a href="#tests">test</a> listed on the
		Monster token.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If the Monster’s <span class="def">horror</span> (the number next to the Sanity icon) is greater than the test result, the
					investigator loses Sanity equal to the difference.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Resolve Strength Test:</strong> The investigator resolves the Strength (}) <a href="#tests">test</a> listed on the
		Monster token.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If the Monster’s <span class="def">damage</span> (the number next to the Health icon) is greater than the test result, the
					investigator loses Health equal to the difference.</li>
				<li>If he passes, the Monster loses Health equal to the test result.
					Indicate this by placing a equal number of Health tokens on
					the Monster token. The investigator and Monster lose
					Health simultaneously.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>When a Monster has lost Health equal to or greater than its
				toughness, the Monster is defeated and returned to the monster cup.</li>
			<li>If a Monster does not have a { or } test, the investigator does
				not resolve that test.</li>
			<li>If an investigator defeats every Monster on his space during the
				Encounter Phase, he may resolve an additional encounter of
				his choice.</li>
		<li>If the investigator did not defeat the Monster, it remains on his
		space along with any Health tokens on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<section class="example">
			<h3 id="combat-example">Combat Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>During the Encounter Phase, Lily Chen is on the same
					space as a Monster and must encounter it in combat.</li>
				<li>Lily flips the Monster token over. It does not have any
					effects that are resolved during combat.</li>
				<li>Lily resolves a { test. She has a { of 3. The Monster
					does not list a modifier, so she rolls 3 dice.</li>
				<li>She rolls 1 success and subtracts it from the Monster’s
					horror ( ) of 2. She loses 1 Sanity (equal to the
					difference).</li>
				<li>Lily resolves a } test. She has a } of 4. She applies
					the Monster’s modifier (–1) and gains a bonus from her
					“.38 Revolver” (+2), so she rolls 5 dice.</li>
				<li>She rolls 1 success, and subtracts it from the Monster’s
					damage ( ) of 1. Since she rolled a number of successes
					equal to its damage, she does not lose any Health.
					Since she rolled 1 success, the Monster loses 1 Health.
					She places 1 Health token on the Monster. Its toughness
					is 2, so it is not defeated and her encounter ends.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<h2 id="epic-monsters">Epic Monsters</h2>
		<p>Some Monsters are so powerful or
		unmanageable that they are immune to
		some effects. Epic Monsters are treated like
		Monsters for all effects except for the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be defeated unless it has lost Health equal
		to or greater than its toughness, at which point it is returned to the game box.</li>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be discarded.</li>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be moved, except by an effect on its
				token or the component that spawned it.</li>
			<li>Epic Monsters are never placed in the Monster cup and are spawned by specific effects that call them out
		by name.</li>
			<li>When an Epic Monster is defeated, it is returned to the game box.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>“Monster” refers to a Monster and/or an Epic Monsters. “Non-Epic Monster” refers to a Monster but not an Epic Monster.</p>

		<h2 id="ambush">Ambush</h2>
		<p>Some effects cause investigators to encounter Monsters that
		are not on the game board. When an effect says “A Monster
		ambushes you,” the investigator draws one random Monster
		from the Monster cup and immediately encounters it in
		<a href="#combat-encounters">combat</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The Monster is not spawned. If it has a “when spawned” effect, do
				not resolve that effect.</li>
<li>After resolving the Combat Encounter, the Monster is discarded
	even if it was not defeated, and the investigator continues
		resolving the effect that caused the ambush.</li>
<li>If a <strong>specific</strong> Monster ambushes an investigator, do not draw a
Monster token. Instead, reference the Monster’s attributes from a
token that has been set aside or is on the game board.</li>
<li>If a <a href="#cultists">Cultist</a> Monster ambushes an investigator, do not draw a
Monster token. Instead, reference the Cultist information on the
Ancient One sheet.</li>
<li>Unlike a normal Combat Encounter, if an investigator is
ambushed by a Monster and he defeats that Monster, he cannot
resolve an additional encounter.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When determining the “nearest” <a href="#what-are-spaces-and-paths">space</a> or token, find the space or
			token separated by the fewest number of interconnected <a href="#what-are-spaces-and-paths">paths</a>.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>If two or more spaces are tied for nearest, the active investigator

		<h2 id="rumors">Rumors</h2>
		<p><span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards often place Rumor
		tokens on specific spaces of the game board.
		An investigator on a space containing a Rumor
		token can encounter the token during the
		Encounter Phase. To do so, he resolves the
		effect on that Mythos card instead of resolving
		an encounter card.</p>
		<p>When a <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card is “solved,” discard the card along with

			<h3 id="how-do-you-determine-a-random-space">How do you Determine a Random Space?</h3>
			<p>Some effects found on <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards and
			Mysteries place tokens on a “random space.” Whenever
			an effect refers to a random space, that space is
			determined by drawing one Clue token from the Clue
			pool and using the space indicated by the back of the
			token. The drawn Clue token is then discarded.</p>
			<p>If there are no Clue tokens remaining in the Clue pool or discard
			pile, the Lead Investigator chooses a space instead.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="mysteries">Mysteries</h2>
		<p>In order to win the game, investigators need to solve a number of
		Mysteries as indicated on the Ancient One sheet. Each Ancient One has its own deck of Mystery cards
		with a unique set of tasks that the investigators must resolve.</p>
		<p>During setup, draw one Mystery card and place it faceup next
		to the Ancient One sheet. Each card lists how investigators can
		solve that Mystery.</p>

		<p>“Active Mystery” refers to the faceup Mystery card in play that has
not yet been solved. When the active Mystery is solved or removed from play, discard
all tokens on it or placed by it. Then draw a new Mystery, placing
it <strong>on top of</strong> any solved Mysteries.</p>

		<p>As soon as investigators solve the number of Mysteries indicated on the front of the Ancient One sheet, investigators win the
		game. If the Ancient One awakens, investigators additionally need to solve
		the <a href="#final-mystery">Final Mystery</a>.</p>

		<p>If a solved Mystery is shuffled into the deck or returned to the
game box, that Mystery no longer counts as a solved Mystery.</p>

		<h2 id="the-ancient-one-awakens">The Ancient One Awakens</h2>
		<p>When the Doom token reaches the “0” space of the Doom
		track, the Ancient One <span class="def">awakens</span>. Flip the Ancient One sheet and
		immediately resolve the “Awakens” effects (if any) on the upper-
		left corner of the sheet. This sheet remains facedown for the rest
		of the game, and its effects replace those found on the front of the
		sheet (including Cultist information). The back of the Ancient
		One sheet describes how the investigators can lose the game and describes the <a href="#final-mystery">Final Mystery</a> which the investigators must complete in
	addition to the other <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p id="awaken-doom">After the Ancient One awakens, Doom cannot retreat. The
Ancient One sheet describes what happens if Doom advances after
the Ancient One awakens.</p>
		<h3 id="eliminated-players">Eliminated Players</h3>
		<p>After the Ancient One has awakened, when an investigator is
		defeated or devoured, the player controlling that investigator is
		<span class="def">eliminated</span>. Eliminated players do not select a new investigator
		to control and can no longer participate in the game.</p>
		<p>If all players are eliminated, investigators lose the game.</p>
		<p>If the investigators win the game, any eliminated players win as well.</p>
		<h3 id="final-mystery">Final Mystery</h3>
		<p>Once the Ancient One awakens, it is much more difficult
		for investigators to win the game. Each Ancient One sheet
		describes one <span class="def">Final Mystery</span> the investigators must solve in
		order to win the game, usually confronting the Ancient One
		head-on.</p>
