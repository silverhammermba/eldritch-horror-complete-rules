		<section>
			<h3 id="using-this-rulebook">Using this Rulebook</h3>

			<p>The official rulebook is still the recommended way to learn the
			game. This document is intended as a definitive resource combining
			all official rules for all expansions, reference guides, FAQs, and
			errata, such that all questions can be clarified by searching one
			document.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h2>

		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is a cooperative game of investigation and
		horror inspired by the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. In each
		game, one of the Ancient Ones, a being of unimaginable power
		that predates time itself, is awakening. Players take on the roles
		of investigators who are attempting to solve mysteries, defend
		humanity from unimaginable horrors, and ultimately banish
		the Ancient One from this world. If investigators fail at their
		task, the Ancient One awakens, and mankind is doomed.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="players-and-investigators">Players and Investigators</h3>

			<p>When playing <em>Eldritch Horror</em>, each player controls an
			investigator. The word “investigator” refers to a player, the in-game character he controls,
and that character’s Investigator sheet and Investigator token. </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3 id="the-golden-rules">The Golden Rules</h3>
<p>Effects on components (such as cards) sometimes contradict
this rulebook. In this
situation, the component’s effect overrules this rulebook.</p>
<p>Restrictive effects on cards are absolute. For example, an
investigator’s Detained Condition says, “You <strong>cannot</strong> move.” That
investigator cannot move or be moved by any action or effect.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3 id="using-expansions">Using Expansions</h3>

			<p>When playing with expansions, add
all expansion components to their respective decks or
pools of Eldritch Horror components. Unless otherwise
instructed, use all components when
playing with expansions.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

		<p>Before playing each game, perform the following steps in order.</p>

		<h3 id="determine-prelude">0. Determine Prelude</h3>

		<p class="mom">Draw one random Prelude card before setting up the game. These cards
		alter game setup and make each game feel unique. The card’s effect is
		resolved immediately after drawing the card, unless it specifies
		different timing, such as “after resolving setup.”</p>


		<h3 id="place-game-board">1. Place Game Board</h3>
		<p>Unfold the game board and place it in the center of the play
		area within easy reach of all players.</p>

		<h4 id="side-board-setup">1.5 Side Board Setup</h4>

		<p class="mom">Side boards are only set up when specifically mentioned
		by game components such as the Ancient One sheet or Prelude card.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Place side board:</strong>
				Unfold the side board and place it near the main board within
				reach of all players.</li>
			<li><strong>Add clues and gates:</strong>
				Add the Clues and Gates that correspond to spaces
				on the side board when constructing the Clue pool and Gate stack, respectively,
				and randomize the Clue pool and Gate stack.</li>
			<li><strong>Set aside monsters:</strong>
				<a href="#set-aside">Set aside</a> Monsters from the Monster cup as indicated on the side board.</li>
			<li><strong>Separate and place decks:</strong>
				Separate all Encounter cards related to the side board into decks and shuffle each
				deck. Place these decks near the side board.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>While side boards are in play, “game board” refers to both
the main board included in Eldritch Horror and the side boards.
“Side board” always refers to a side board and not the main board.</p>

		<h3 id="organize-tokens">2. Organize Tokens</h3>
		<p>Organize the following tokens as listed below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li id="gate-stack">Create the <a href="#what-are-gates">Gate</a> stack by randomizing the nine Gate tokens,
				and placing them facedown (common side up) in a stack
				within reach of all players.
			<ul>
				<li>Gates are kept facedown in the Gate stack until they are spawned.</li>
				<li>When a Gate is closed, it is discarded.</li>
						<li>When a Gate is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard pile
near the Gate stack until the Gate stack is empty. When there are
no Gates remaining in the Gate stack, place all discarded Gates
facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li id="clue-pool">Create the <a href="#what-are-clues">Clue</a> pool by placing the Clue tokens facedown
				(common side up) in a pile within reach of all players and
				randomize them.
			<ul>
				<li>Clues are kept facedown in the Clue pool until they are spawned,
					discarded, or gained by investigators.</li>
<li>When a Clue token is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard
pile near the Clue pool until the Clue pool is empty. When there
are no Clue tokens remaining in the Clue pool, place all discarded
Clue tokens facedown in the Clue pool and randomize them.</li>
<li>When an effect spawns a Clue, draw one random Clue token from
the Clue pool and place it on the space indicated on the front of
that token.</li>
<li>When an effect spawns a Clue on a specific space, draw one Clue
token from the Clue pool and place it on the space specified by the
effect. The space indicated on the front of the Clue token is not
referenced.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Create the general token pool by taking all Health, Sanity,
				Improvement, Impairment, Travel Ticket, Eldritch, Mystery, Rumor, Adventure, and <span
					class="mom">Focus</span> tokens and place them in piles
				within reach of all players. These tokens are always
available. If the general token pool has no remaining tokens of any one type,
track those tokens on paper or with a small object such as a coin.
			<ul>
				<li>Eldritch tokens are a generic resource used by many effects,
					including the Ancient One.</li>
				<li>A component that places an Eldritch token on the game board
					describes how investigators interact with that token.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ol>
		<h3 id="choose-and-place-investigators">3. Choose and Place Investigators</h3>
		<p>Players agree upon one player to receive the Lead Investigator
		token. If they cannot decide, players assign this token to a
		random player as they see fit (for example, by rolling a die).
		Starting with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise,
		each player chooses one investigator. He takes the corresponding
		Investigator sheet, then places the matching Investigator token on
		the game board space listed on the back of his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Each Investigator sheet has an action ability that the investigator
may perform during the Action Phase and a passive ability that
affect how he and other investigators interact with the game.</li>
<li>Each Investigator sheet lists the investigator’s maximum Health
and Sanity and five skills: Lore ([), Influence (]),
Observation (|), Strength (}), and Will ({).</li>
<li><p>The back of each Investigator sheet indicates the investigator’s
starting location, including a map for reference, and his starting
possessions, Conditions, and effects.</p>
	<p>It also indicates the investigator’s defeated investigator encounters,
	including a Crippled effect and an Insane effect.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="receive-starting-possessions-health-and-sanity">4. Receive Starting Possessions, Health, and Sanity</h3>
		<p>Each investigator receives the starting possessions listed on the back
		of his Investigator sheet. He gains any Assets or
		Spells listed by taking the matching card from the game box.
		Then he takes a number of <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</a> tokens equal to
		his investigator’s maximum Health and Sanity listed on the
		front of his Investigator sheet. He places these tokens near his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<h3 id="determine-ancient-one">5. Determine Ancient One</h3>
		<p>As a group, players choose one of the Ancient One sheets. Each
		Ancient One provides a different game experience. For their first
		game, it is recommended players choose “Azathoth,” as he is the
		most straightforward Ancient One. Place the chosen sheet faceup
		(displaying a <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">Doom</a> value in the top
		left corner) near the game board and
		<strong>resolve any setup effects on the sheet</strong>.

		<ul>
			<li>The chosen Ancient One sheet determines the
				Ancient One for the entire game.</li>
<li>The Ancient One’s illustration is featured on the back of the
	<a href="#special-encounters">Special Encounters</a>, <a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounters</a>, and <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a> that
correspond to it.</li>
<li>The Ancient One’s effects may set aside Monster tokens or other
	components.</li>
<li>The Ancient One sheet defines the specific information of <a href="#cultists">Cultist</a>
	Monsters.</li>
<li>When the Ancient One <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">awakens</a>, flip the sheet and resolve its
	“awakens” effects, if any.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="create-monster-cup">6. Create <a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster Cup</a></h3>
		<p>Take all non-epic, non-set-aside Monster tokens and place them in an opaque
		container such as a bowl, mug, or the cover of the game box
		(not shown in setup diagram). Then shake this container to
		randomize the Monster tokens.
		<p><strong>Do not place the <a href="#epic-monsters">Epic Monster</a> tokens in the Monster cup</strong>.
		Epic Monster tokens are marked by their red color and clipped
		lower-left corner.
		<h3 id="separate-and-place-decks">7. Separate and Place Decks</h3>
		<p>Take all Research Encounter cards, Special Encounter cards,
		and Mystery cards that do not correspond to the chosen
		Ancient One and return them to the game box. Those cards will not be used for this game.

		<section>
			<h3 id="ancient-one-specific-cards">Ancient One Specific Cards</h3>
			<p>Each Ancient One has at least two unique decks of cards: the
			Mystery deck and the Research deck. Some Ancient Ones
			also have Special Encounter decks called out in their
			setup effect.</p>
			<p id="special-encounters">The illustrations on the back of each Special Encounter indicates
the Ancient One and the Mystery or Final Mystery it corresponds
to. Special Encounter cards also share their title with the Mystery
or Final Mystery they correspond to.</p>
			<p>The instructions for resolving Special Encounters are defined by the
			Ancient One sheet or Mystery cards.</p>
		</section>

		<p>Then separate all other cards as listed below and place them
		near the game board.</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="expedition-deck">Shuffle all <a href="#complex-encounters">Expedition</a> Encounter cards into a single deck,
				regardless of card back.</li>
			<li>Shuffle the Spell cards, Condition cards, and <span class="mom"><a href="#unique-assets">Unique Asset</a> cards</span> into
				separate decks. Place these decks faceup, with the top
				card’s name and artwork visible.</li>
			<li class=sr">The Mystic Ruins Encounter deck is only set up when
				specifically mentioned by another component such as the Ancient
				One or Prelude, otherwise return those cards to the game
			box.</li>
			<li>Set the Mythos cards aside for step 8. Then separate all
				other cards into decks by card back and shuffle each deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="build-mythos-deck">8. Build Mythos Deck</h3>

		<p>The Mythos deck is built differently each game, based on the
		instructions on the bottom of the Ancient One sheet. To build this deck,
		perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Separate all Mythos cards into three piles, based upon
				the color on the front of the card (green, yellow, and
				blue). Shuffle each separately, and place them facedown.</li>
			<li>Build stage I of the Mythos deck by taking random
				cards of the denoted colors and quantities (listed at the
				bottom of the Ancient One sheet) and shuffling them
				together. Do not look at the cards at this time.</li>
			<li>Then build stage II of the Mythos deck (following the
				same steps as stage I) and place it <strong>under</strong> the stage I deck.</li>
			<li>Finally, build stage III of the Mythos deck and place
				it <strong>under</strong> the stage II deck to create a single Mythos
				deck. Once created, <strong>do not shuffle this deck</strong>. Place the
				deck near the Ancient One sheet. Return all remaining
				Mythos cards to the game box without looking at them.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="resolve-starting-effects">9. Resolve Starting Effects</h3>
		<p>Resolve the following effects to complete setup:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the Reference card that corresponds to
				the number of players near the Mythos deck.
				Players use the Reference card when resolving
				Mythos effects. Return all other Reference
				cards to the game box.</li>
			<li>Place the Doom token on the space of the
				Doom track listed on the upper-left corner of
				the Ancient One sheet. For example, the
				Azathoth sheet denotes that the Doom token
				starts on the “15” space of the Doom track.</li>
			<li>Place the Omen token on the green (comet)
				space of the Omen track.</li>
			<li id="reserve">Place the top four cards of the Asset deck faceup in the four
				slots of the reserve (at the bottom-left of the game board). Whenever a card is gained or discarded from the reserve, the active
investigator places the top card from the Asset deck faceup in its
place except during an <a href="#acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets</a> action.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Gates indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Gate, take the top Gate token from the Gate
				stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
				Gate token. Then draw one random Monster token from
				the Monster cup and place it on the same space.</li>
			<li>Place the Active Expedition token on the space that
				corresponds to the illustration on the back of the top card
				of the Expedition Encounter deck. If the top
card of the Expedition Encounter deck changes for any reason, move the token to the
appropriate space.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Clues indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Clue, take one random Clue token from the
				Clue pool and place it facedown on the space indicated on
				the face of the Clue token.</li>
			<li>Finally, draw one Mystery card and place it near the Ancient
				One sheet. Then resolve any “When this card enters play”
				effects on that card.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="hidden-information">Hidden Information</h2>
		<p>Some information is intentionally hidden from players. The following
cannot be examined by players unless they are instructed by some
effect:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The back of <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided cards</a>, such as Spells or Conditions.</li>
			<li>The order and specific cards found in any deck.</li>
			<li>The front of Clues or Gates that are in the Clue pool or Gate stack.</li>
			<li>Mythos cards that have been returned to the game box.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Information that is not hidden includes the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The back of Monster tokens.</li>
	<li>The cards in discard piles.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Investigator sheets.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Ancient One sheets.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Clue tokens that are in the discard pile or held by an investigator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although players may legally look at this information, they may find
the game more exciting if they do not look at this information unless
instructed by some effect. </p>

		<h2 id="set-aside">Set Aside</h2>

		<p>During setup, some components might be set aside. Keep these
		components near the Ancient One sheet.</p>
		<ul>
<li>Cards that have been set aside are separated by card back, shuffled,
	and placed face down next to the Ancient One sheet.</li>
<li>When a component that was set aside during setup is discarded, it
is not returned to the deck or pool like other components of that
type. Instead, it is set aside again.</li>
<li>Components that are set aside cannot be used except by effects
that specifically name them. For example, a Monster token that
has been set aside cannot be spawned except by an effect that
specifically names that token.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is a cooperative game. All players are on the
		same team and <a href="#winning-the-game">win or lose</a> the game together. The investigators’
		ultimate goal is to banish the Ancient One from this world by
		solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p>In addition, investigators need to deal with many threats and
		crises facing the world. These appear in the form of Gates
		(which spawn Monsters and can awaken the Ancient One) and
		<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards (which harm investigators and can end
		the game prematurely).</p>

		<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is played over a series of game rounds. Each
		round consists of three phases that are resolved in the following
		order:</p>
		<ol id="lead-investigator">
			<li><a href="#phase-action-phase"><strong>Action Phase:</strong></a> Investigators perform actions to move about
				the game board and prepare for the tasks ahead.</li>
			<li><a href="#phase-encounter-phase"><strong>Encounter Phase:</strong></a> Investigators fight Monsters or resolve
				encounter cards on their current space.</li>
			<li><a href="#phase-mythos-phase"><strong>Mythos Phase:</strong></a> The Lead Investigator resolves one Mythos
				card. These cards often advance the Doom token, spawn
				Gates, or raise other challenges that investigators will need
				to overcome.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The player who has the Lead Investigator token is referred to as the
“Lead Investigator” by cards and effects. At the end of each Mythos Phase, the Lead Investigator may
		pass the Lead Investigator token to any player of his choice.
		Investigators then start a new game round beginning with the
		Action Phase. Players continue resolving game rounds until
		they have won or lost the game.</p>

		<p><span class="def">Active investigator</span> refers to the investigator currently performing
actions or resolving an encounter. During the Mythos Phase, the
Lead Investigator is the active investigator.</p>

		<p>If multiple effects would be resolved at the same time during the game, the active
		investigator decides the order in which they are resolved.</p>
		<p>When investigators make a decision as a group, the Lead
		Investigator makes the final decision.</p>

		<h2 id="phase-action-phase">Phase 1: Action Phase</h2>
		<p>Performing actions is the main way in which investigators move
		about the game board and acquire beneficial cards and tokens
		(such as Asset cards and travel tickets).</p>
		<p>During the Action Phase, each investigator may perform up to two
		actions. The <a href="#lead-investigator">Lead Investigator</a> performs his two actions first, then
proceeding clockwise around the play area, each other investigator
performs his two actions.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Important:</strong> Each investigator can perform each action <strong>only
			once</strong> during a round. For example, an investigator cannot
		perform two Rest actions.</li>
		<li>If an investigator cannot or does not wish to perform an action, he
			may choose not to perform his action or actions.</li>
<li>An investigator must fully resolve an action before performing
another action. For example, he cannot interrupt a Travel action
with a Trade action, and then continue moving.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During the Action Phase, investigators may perform the
		following actions. The detailed rules for these actions are
		explained in the following sections.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#travel-action">Travel</a></li>
			<li><a href="#rest-action">Rest</a></li>

		<h3 id="travel-action">Travel Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator moves to any space adjacent to his current
		space. Then he may spend any number of <a href="#prepare-for-travel-action">travel tickets</a>, moving one
additional space along a Train path or Ship path for each Train Ticket
token or Ship Ticket token spent, respectively.
		The <a href="#action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</a>
		includes an example of a Travel action.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-spaces-and-paths">What are Spaces and Paths?</h3>
			<p>The different types of spaces and paths are shown on the
			“Legend” on the game board.</p>
			<p>Tokens are often placed on spaces of the game board.
			Spaces include named locations (such as “Arkham”), as
			well as numbered locations.</p>

			<p>Each space is connected to at least one other space by
			lines known as <span class="def">paths</span>. Two spaces are adjacent if they are connected by a single unbroken path.</p>
			<p>Train and Ship paths each correspond to a type of travel ticket.</p>

			<h3 id="local-paths">Local Paths</h3>

			<p class="mom">When playing with a side board, Local paths connect some spaces with dashed green lines. Spaces connected by Local paths
are so close to each other that moving between them does not
require an action.</p>
			<p>During the Action Phase, an investigator may move along any
			number of interconnected Local paths.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Each investigator may perform this movement only
				once per round.</li>
<li>This movement does not require an action but cannot
be performed by a Delayed investigator.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<h3 id="rest-action">Rest Action</h3>
		<p>The investigator recovers 1 <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health</a> and 1 <a href="#health-and-sanity">Sanity</a>.</p>
		<p>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> perform this action if there is a Monster
		on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="trade-action">Trade Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator can trade any number of <a href="#possessions">possessions</a> with
another investigator on his space. The two investigators may freely give
any number of possessions to the other, as long as both investigators
agree to this trade.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Condition cards, Health tokens, Sanity tokens, and Improvement
				tokens cannot be traded.</li>
			<li>Investigators cannot trade with <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated</a> investigators.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="prepare-for-travel-action">Prepare for Travel Action</h3>
		<p>If the investigator is <strong>on a City space</strong>, he gains one travel ticket
		of his choice. The investigator cannot gain a Train Ticket unless
		there is at least one Train path connected to his space. Likewise,
		he cannot gain a Ship Ticket unless there is at least one Ship
		path connected to his space.</p>
		<p>An investigator cannot have more than two travel tickets. If he
already has two travel tickets when he would gain a new one, he may
discard one travel ticket before gaining the new travel ticket.</p>


		<h3 id="acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator <strong>on a City space</strong> <a href="#tests">tests</a> ]. Then he may
		gain any number of cards from the <a href="#reserve">reserve</a> with total <span class="def">value</span> (the number in the upper-left corner) equal to or
less than the test result.
<ul>
	<li>If he is unable or chooses not to gain any cards from the reserve, he
		may instead discard one card of his choice from the reserve.</li>
	<li>An investigator on a space containing a Monster <strong>cannot</strong> perform
	this action.</li>
</ul>

		<h4 id="bank-loan">Bank Loan</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator performs an Acquire Assets action, he may
gain a Debt Condition to immediately add 2 successes to his test
result.</li>
<li>If an investigator already has a Debt Condition, he cannot acquire
	a Bank Loan.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>After completely resolving an Acquire Assets action, replace any cards
		discarded or gained from the reserve by drawing replacement
		cards from the Asset deck.</p>

		<p>Related Topics: <a href="#gaining-possessions-and-conditions">Gaining Possessions and Conditions</a></p>

		<h3 id="focus-action">Focus Action</h3>

		<p class="mom">As an action, an investigator on any space
		gains one Focus token. An investigator cannot have more than two Focus
		tokens. Focus tokens can be spent when resolving a <a href="#tests">test</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="component-actions">Component Actions</h3>
		<p>The investigator may perform an action listed on one of his
		components (such as Investigator sheets, Conditions, and <a href="#possessions">possessions</a>). These
		actions are preceded by the word “Action” in bold.</p>

		<p>Like all actions, each component action can only be performed
once per round. Although an investigator cannot perform a component action
		from a single component more than once each round, he can
		perform component actions of different components. Multiple investigators <strong>cannot</strong> perform the same
		action on one component during a single round, except for <a href="#local-action">local
			actions</a>. For example, if an investigator uses a component action
on an Asset and then trades it to another investigator, the new
owner cannot use the component action that round.</p>

		<p class="example">Example: Lily Chen uses the action ability printed on her
		Investigator sheet. Then, for her second action, she could perform
		an action printed on an Asset card she has.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>An action ability on an Investigator sheet can be performed only
				by that investigator.</li>
			<li>An action ability on a possession or Condition can be performed
				only by the investigator who has the card.</li>
			<li id="local-action">An investigator may also perform some actions using
				components held by other investigators on his space. These
				actions are preceded by the phrase “Local Action” in bold. An investigator may perform local actions on his own possessions
and Conditions. Multiple investigators may perform the same local action during the
course of a single Action Phase.</li>
			<li class="mom">A space’s “Local Action” ability can be performed only by
investigators on that space. Each investigator may perform the
“Local Action” ability of each space only once per round.</li>
		</ul>


		<section class="example">
			<h3 id="action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on San Francisco at the start of the Action
					Phase. Since he has the Lead Investigator token, Silas
					resolves his two actions first.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s first action, he performs a Travel action. He
					moves from San Francisco to space 5.</li>
				<li>During his Travel action, he decides to spend his Train
					Ticket to move one additional space along the Train
					path to Arkham.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s second action, he decides to perform a Rest
					action to recover 1 Health and 1 Sanity. Since he already
					has Sanity tokens equal to his maximum Sanity, he only
					recovers the 1 Health. He takes 1 Health from the token
					pool and places it by his Investigator sheet.</li>
			</ol>
<p>Silas has performed his two actions. The investigator to
					his left may now perform two actions.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="phase-encounter-phase">Phase 2: Encounter Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, each investigator must resolve <strong>one encounter</strong>.
		Encounters often involve reading a short narrative on an
		encounter card which can have positive and/or negative effects. We recommend a player other
than the active investigator reads encounter cards and does not reveal
the results of passing or failing a test that has not yet been resolved.</p>
		<p>The investigators resolve encounters in turn order starting
with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise around the play
area.</p>
		<p>During the Encounter Phase, if an investigator is on a space
		containing one or more Monsters, he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single
		Combat Encounter against each Monster on that space, one at a
		time, in the order of his choice. If there are zero Monsters on an
		investigator’s space, he instead resolves a location encounter or a
		token encounter of his choice as described in the sections below. If an investigator has the option of multiple encounters, he chooses
one.</p>

		<p>If an investigator has a Detained Condition card, he resolves the
back of his Condition card instead of resolving an encounter. He
does this <strong>even if</strong> there is a Monster on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="combat-encounters">Combat Encounters</h3>

		<p>If an investigator is on a space containing one or more Monsters,
		he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single <a href="#combat-encounter">Combat Encounter</a> against each
		Monster on that space.</p>
		<p>After an investigator resolves all Combat Encounters, if there are
		no Monsters in his space, <strong>he may resolve another encounter</strong>.</p>

		<h3 id="location-encounters">Location Encounters</h3>
		<p>The investigator draws an encounter card matching his space’s
		artwork or from the General Encounter deck. He resolves the
		effect that matches his current space, then discards the card. When an encounter deck is empty, immediately shuffle its discard pile
to form a new deck.</p>
		<p>If an investigator has multiple types of encounter cards that he
		could draw, he chooses which deck to draw from.</p>
		<p class="example">Example: An investigator is on Arkham. He can choose to draw
		a card from either the General Encounter deck or the America
		Encounter deck. If he chooses to draw a General Encounter card,
		he then resolves the “City” portion of the card.</p>
		<p>The text below some named spaces
		on the game board lists the most
		common effects found in those specific
		encounters.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator may encounter his
space by drawing a General Encounter card and resolving the
effect that corresponds to his space’s type.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Arkham, Buenos
Aires, or San Francisco may encounter that space by drawing an
America Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds
to his space’s name.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Istanbul,
London, or Rome may encounter that space by drawing a Europe
Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds to his
space’s name.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Shanghai, Sydney,
or Tokyo may encounter that space by drawing an Asia/Australia
Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds to his
space’s name.</li>
<li class="mom">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Miskatonic
Outpost, Lake Camp, or Frozen Waste may encounter that
space by drawing an Outpost Encounter and resolving the
effect that corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="mom">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Snowy
Mountains, City of the Elder Things, or Plateau of Leng may
encounter that space by drawing a Mountain Encounter and
resolving the effect that corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="utp">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Alexandria,
The Bent Pyramid, or Cairo may encounter that space by
drawing an Egypt Encounter and resolving the effect that
corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="utp">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on The Sahara
Desert, Tel el-Amarna, or The Nile River may encounter that
space by drawing an Africa Encounter and resolving the effect
that corresponds to his space.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="token-encounters">Token Encounters</h3>
		<p>Some tokens are placed on spaces of the game board and provide
		additional encounter options for investigators on that space.</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="research-encounters">Clue tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve
				Research Encounter cards.
				<ul>
					<li>When a Research Encounter says, “this Clue,” it is referring to the
						Clue being encountered.</li>
					<li>If the Clue token being encountered is not gained or discarded, it
						remains on its space and can be encountered again.</li>
					<li>When a Research Encounter says, “additional Clue,” it is referring
						to Clues in the Clue pool.</li>
					<li class="mom">When an investigator encounters a Clue on the Antarctica side
						board, he does not resolve a Research Encounter for the chosen
						Ancient One. Instead, he draws and resolves an Antarctica
						Research Encounter.
						An Antarctica Research Encounter is considered a Research
						Encounter for all game effects.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li id="other-world-encounters">Gate tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve Other
					World Encounter cards.
					<ul>
						<li>When an Other World Encounter says, “this Gate,” it is referring
							to the Gate being encountered.</li>
						<li>If an Other World Encounter card instructs an investigator to
							“close this Gate,” he discards the Gate token from his space.</li>
						<li>While an investigator is resolving an Other World Encounter, he is
							still considered to be on his current space and is not removed from
							the game board.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>The Active Expedition token allows investigators to draw
						and resolve <a href="#expedition-deck">Expedition Encounter</a> cards.
						<ul>
							<li>After resolving an Expedition Encounter, the investigator
								moves the Active Expedition token to the space that matches
								the newly-revealed top card of the Expedition Encounter deck.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li class="sr">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on a space
						containing the Mystic Ruins token may encounter it by
						drawing and resolving the top card of the Mystic Ruins
						Encounter deck.
						<ul>
							<li>The Mystic Ruins token is placed
on the space corresponding to
the top card of the Mystic Ruins
Encounter deck. This space is
referred to as the “Mystic Ruins
space.” If the top card of the Mystic
Ruins Encounter deck changes for
any reason, move the Mystic Ruins
token to the appropriate space.</li>
							<li>Each Mystic Ruins Encounter’s back indicates the space
								it corresponds to.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Rumor tokens allow investigators to resolve the encounter
						listed on the <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card that refers to that space.</li>
					<li><a href="#defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigator</a> tokens allow investigators to resolve

		</ul>

		<h2 id="phase-mythos-phase">Phase 3: Mythos Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, the Lead Investigator draws the top card of
		the Mythos deck. If the Mythos deck is empty, the discard pile is not shuffled into
the deck. Instead, if a Mythos card cannot be drawn, the Mythos
Phase ends and investigators lose the game.</p>

		<p>There are seven possible effects on a Mythos
		card, and the Lead Investigator resolves them <strong>in the order they
			appear</strong> (left to right, starting from the top). The order and
		effects of each element are listed below:</p>
		<section>
			<h3 id="advance-omen">Advance Omen</h3>
			<p>Move the Omen token one space clockwise
			around <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">the track</a>. Then <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks"><strong>advance Doom</strong></a> by
			one for each Gate on the game board that
			matches the Omen token’s current space.</p>
			<h3 id="resolve-reckoning-effects">Resolve Reckoning Effects</h3>
			<p>Resolve all effects proceeded by a @ icon
			on components in play. These components
			are marked with a red reckoning icon in the
			lower-right corner as a visual reminder.</p>
			<p>Resolve these effects in the following order:
			Monsters, Ancient One sheet, <span class="trait">Ongoing</span>
			Mythos cards, and lastly starting with the Lead Investigator
and proceeding clockwise, each investigator resolves the @ effect
on each possession and Condition he has, if any, in the order of his
choice.</p>
			<p>If a Mythos card has the icon on the lower-right corner, it is a
reminder that the card has a @ effect. That card does not cause
other @ effects to be resolved.</p>
			<p>If a Monster is spawned or an investigator gains a component
while investigators are resolving @ effects, they do not resolve the
@ effect on that Monster or component.</p>

			<h3 id="spawn-gates">Spawn Gates</h3>
			<p><a href="#spawning-gates">Spawn a number of Gates</a> as defined by the
			Reference card.</p>
			<h3 id="monster-surge">Monster Surge</h3>
			<p>At <strong>each gate</strong> that matches the Omen
			token’s current space, <a href="#spawning-monsters">spawn the number of
				Monsters</a> listed on the Reference card.
			If there are no matching Gates currently on
			the game board, spawn one Gate instead.</p>
			<h3 id="spawn-clues">Spawn Clues</h3>
			<p><a href="#spawning-clues">Spawn a number of Clues</a> as defined by the

			<h3 id="place-rumor-token">Place Rumor Token</h3>
			<p>Place a <a href="#rumors">Rumor</a> token on the space listed.</p>
			<h3 id="place-eldritch-tokens">Place Eldritch Tokens</h3>
			<p>Place the listed number of Eldritch tokens
			on this Mythos card.</p>
			<h3 id="resolve-effect">Resolve Effect</h3>
			<p>If the card has the <span class="trait">Event</span> trait listed above
			the text effect, immediately resolve the
			effect and then discard the card. If it has
			the <span class="trait">Ongoing</span> trait, place it in play near the
			Ancient One sheet. It remains in play until
			discarded by a game effect.</p>
		</section>
		<p>Investigators <strong>resolve only the effects displayed on the current
			Mythos card</strong>. For example, if the Mythos card does not have the
		spawn clues icon, investigators do not resolve the spawn clues step.</p>

		<section id="doom">
			<h3 id="what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">What are the Doom and Omen Tracks?</h3>
			<p>The <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">Ancient One awakens</a> when Doom reaches the “0” space of the <span class="def">Doom track</span>. When Doom
			<span class="def">advances</span>, move the Doom token <strong>toward</strong> the “0” space of
			the Doom track. If the Ancient One has not awoken, when Doom retreats, move the Doom
			token <strong>away from</strong> the “0” space of the Doom track.</p>
			<p>If an effect advances Doom beyond the “0” space, Doom advances
to 0, the Ancient One awakens, and then Doom continues to
advance using the Ancient One’s <a href="#awaken-doom">rules for advancing Doom</a>.</p>
			<p>The <span class="def">Omen track’s</span> purpose is to advance Doom. When the Omen advances, move the Omen token the indicated
number of spaces clockwise around the Omen track one space at a
time. For each space it enters, advance Doom by one for each Gate
on the game board that corresponds to the current Omen.</p>
			<p>The “current Omen” is the icon on the space of the Omen track
containing the Omen token.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-gates">Spawning Gates</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Gate, take the top Gate token from
		the Gate stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
		Gate token.</p>
		<p>When a Gate is spawned, <strong>a <a href="#spawning-monsters">Monster is spawned</a> on the same
			space</strong>.</p>
		<p>If an effect would spawn a Gate and the Gate stack and discard
		pile are empty, <strong>advance Doom by one instead</strong>.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-gates">What are Gates?</h3>
			<p>Gate tokens represent tears in the fabric of reality. These
			gateways can lead to other worlds, dimensions, or even
			points in time. These dangerous anomalies allow deadly
			powers into our world, such as Monsters and eventually
			even the Ancient Ones.</p>
			<p>Gates are the main way that Doom <a href="#advance-omen">advances</a>. To prevent
			Doom from advancing (and the Ancient One from
			awakening), investigators need to resolve <a href="#other-world-encounters">Other World
				Encounter</a> cards to close (discard) Gates.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-monsters">Spawning Monsters</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Monster, draw one random Monster
		token from the <a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster cup</a> and place it on the space indicated
		by the effect.</p>
		<p>If the Monster has the spawn icon, look at the
		back of the Monster token and resolve its effect
		immediately after spawning it (for example,
		“When this Monster is spawned, move it to
		Heart of Africa”).</p>
		<p>Monsters cannot be spawned from the Monster cup if the Monster
cup is empty. Set aside Monsters cannot be spawned if all set aside
Monsters of the named type are on the game board.</p>

		<h4 id="cultists">Cultists</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Unlike most Monsters, a Cultist Monster does not have
				information printed on the back of its Monster token.</li>
<li>When an investigator encounters a Cultist Monster, he references
the Cultist information on the Ancient One sheet. This includes
its { test, } test, horror, damage, toughness, and effects.</li>
<li>All Cultist Monsters have and icons printed on their fronts.
These icons remind players to check the Ancient One sheet, which
may list a “When this Monster is spawned,” or @ effect.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="what-is-the-monster-cup">What is the Monster Cup?</h3>
		<p>During setup, players choose any opaque container,
		such as the game box lid, to serve as the Monster
		cup. When a Monster is spawned, one player draws a
		random Monster token from the Monster cup without
		looking. When a Monster is defeated or discarded,
		return it to the Monster cup. Then shake the container
		to randomize the Monster tokens.</p>
		<h3 id="spawning-clues">Spawning Clues</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Clue, take one random Clue token
		from the Clue pool and place it facedown on the space
		indicated on the Clue token.</p>
		<p>Clues cannot be spawned or gained from the Clue pool if the Clue
		pool and discard pile are empty.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-clues">What are Clues?</h3>
			<p>Clue tokens represent secrets and lore about the Ancient
			One. Investigators can collect these tokens by resolving
			<a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounters</a>.</p>
			<p>Investigators use Clues to solve <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>, solve <a href="#rumors">Rumors</a>, and to reroll dice
			during <a href="#tests">tests</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="winning-the-game">Winning the Game</h2>
		<p>The game immediately ends when an effect specifies that
		“Investigators win the game,” or “Investigators lose the game.” In the
		rare circumstance that both of these effects happen at the same time,
		investigators win the game.</p>
		<p>Investigators win the game by solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a> as indicated on the front
		of the Ancient One sheet.</p>
		<p>Investigators <strong>lose the game</strong> if any of the following occur:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">Ancient One awakens</a>, the back of the Ancient
				One sheet lists how investigators can lose the game.</li>
			<li>All investigators have been <a href="#eliminated-players"><strong>eliminated</strong></a> from the game.</li>
			<li>A card effect causes investigators to lose the game. This
				most frequently appears on some <a href="#rumors"><span class="trait">Rumor</span></a> Mythos cards.</li>
			<li>The investigators are required to draw a Mythos card but
				cannot because the <strong>Mythos deck is empty</strong>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
		<p>Many effects require investigators to resolve a test, which involves
		rolling dice to determine whether he passes or fails the test. Passing
		tests often provides benefits to the investigator, while failing tests
		often have negative side effects. When an investigator resolves a test,
		he performs the following steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Determine Dice Pool:</strong> The investigator determines the number of
				dice he will roll. This number is his <span class="def">dice pool</span>.
			<ul>
				<li>He starts with a number equal to the <a href="#what-are-skills">skill</a> being tested.</li>
				<li>He adds or subtracts the test modifier (the number that follows
					the skill icon on the effect).</li>
				<li>If he has an Improvement token for the skill being tested, he
					adds the Improvement token’s modifier.</li>
				<li>He may use <strong>one</strong> effect that provides a bonus (for example “Gain
					+3 {”). If multiple effects provide a bonus, he uses only <strong>the
						highest bonus</strong>.</li>
				<li>He adds any “additional dice” he gains from effects that apply.
					Additional dice are cumulative and are in addition to other
					effects.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> He rolls a number of dice equal to his dice pool.
				<ul>
					<li>If an investigator’s dice pool is below 1, he rolls 1 die instead.</li>
					<li>If an investigator’s dice pool is greater than the number of dice
						available, he rolls as many dice as possible, counts his successes,
						and rolls the dice again until he has rolled a number of dice
						equal to his dice pool.</li>
					<li>Immediately after rolling, some game effects may allow the investigator to <a href="#rerolling-dice">reroll</a> some dice.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>Determine Result:</strong> Each “5” or “6” rolled is one <span class="def">success</span>. The
					total number of successes rolled is the <span class="def">test result</span>. If he rolls
					at least one success, he passes the test. If he does not roll any
					successes, he <span class="def">fails</span> the test.</li>
				<li><strong>Resolve Pass or Fail Effect:</strong> The consequence of passing or failing
					the test is determined by the effect that triggered the test.</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Some effects specify only a pass effect or a fail effect. If an
				investigator passes a test that does not have a pass effect, there is no
				effect. Likewise, if an investigator fails a test that does not have a
				fail effect, he suffers no ill effects.</li>
			<li>On encounter cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
				embedded in the text in parentheses. The test declaration may also
				indicate a test modifier.</li>
			<li>Effects that are dependent on a test are always preceded by “if you
				pass,” or “if you fail.” Any effect in that sentence occurs only if you
				pass the test or fail the test, respectively. Any effect after the period
				or part of a new paragraph, is independent from previous effects.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="example">Example: Lily Chen has an “Arcane Tome” Asset card which reads:
		“When you perform a Rest action, you may test [. If you pass,
		gain 1 Spell.” When resting, Lily resolves this test using her Lore
		([) of 2. She rolls 2 dice with results of “1” and “3.” Since she
		did not roll a “5” or “6,” she fails the test does not gain a Spell.</p>

		<h3 id="tests-on-cards">Tests on Cards</h3>
		<p>On many cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
		embedded in parenthesis following a short narrative. When an
		investigator is resolving an effect that includes a skill icon in the
		text, he must immediately test that skill. The test declaration
		may also indicate a modifier (such as “–1”), which causes the
		investigator to roll more or fewer dice in the test.</p>
		<p>Note that most gameplay terms are capitalized on cards to help
		differentiate them from narrative text.</p>

		<h3 id="rerolling-dice">Rerolling Dice</h3>
		<p>Immediately after rolling dice during a test, an investigator
		may spend a Clue token or a <span class="mom">Focus token</span> to reroll one die.</p>
		<p>If multiple effects allow an investigator to reroll a die, he may
resolve each effect separately. There is no limit to the number of
times a die or test can be rerolled, so long as the investigator has
the means to do so. There is no limit to the number of Clues or <span class="mom">Focus</span> he can spend
to reroll dice.</p>
		<p>When a die is rerolled, use the result of the reroll, even if the new
		result is worse. He determines whether he passed or failed after resolving all rerolls.</p>

		<p>Most reroll effects (including spending Clue tokens) specifically
		reroll dice <strong>during a test</strong>. Such effects cannot be used on other die
rolls, such as the @ effect of a Blessed Condition card.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-skills">What are Skills?</h3>
			<p>Each investigator has five different skills listed on the
			bottom of his Investigator sheet. The number below
			each skill is the base number of dice the investigator rolls
			when resolving a <a href="#tests">test</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lore ([) is often tested when casting <a href="#spells">Spells</a> and resolving
					Other World Encounters.</li>
				<li>Influence (]) is often tested when performing the Acquire
					Assets action and resolving General Encounters on City spaces
					and Defeated Investigator Encounters.</li>
				<li>Observation (|) is often tested when resolving Research
					Encounters and Expedition Encounters.</li>
				<li>Strength (}) is often tested when resolving Combat
					Encounters and Expedition Encounters.</li>
				<li>Will ({) is often tested when resolving Combat Encounters and
					Other World Encounters.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<h3 id="improvement-tokens">Improvement Tokens</h3>
		<p>These tokens represent an investigator’s training
		in particular skills. When an effect allows an
		investigator to improve a skill, he gains an
		Improvement token with the matching icon and
		places it below his Investigator sheet with the “+1” side up.
		If he improves that skill a second time, he flips that token to
		the “+2” side. An investigator cannot improve a single skill more than twice. An investigator’s skill is equal to the value printed
		on his sheet plus the value of the matching Improvement token.</p>

		<h3 id="impairment-tokens">Impairment Tokens</h3>
		<p class="utp">Impairment tokens represent a permanent impairment
		to an investigator’s skills.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator impairs a skill, he gains an
				Impairment token for that skill with the “–1” side up.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If an investigator already has an Impairment token for
					that skill, he flips that token to the “–2” side instead.
					Each “–2” Impairment token counts as two “–1”
					Impairment tokens.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Improvement tokens and Impairment tokens negate one
				another. If an investigator has both an Improvement token
				and an Impairment token for the same skill, he discards
				both tokens.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot impair a skill if doing so reduces that
				skill’s modified value to below 1.
				<ul>
					<li>An investigator cannot choose to impair a skill if doing so
						would reduce that skill’s modified value to below 1.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>An investigator cannot impair a single skill more than twice.
					<ul>
						<li>An investigator cannot choose to impair a skill if that skill
							has already been impaired twice.</li>
					</ul></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="skill-values">Skill Values</h3>
		<p class="utp">Some effects reference
an investigator’s skills as a value. A skill’s value is equal to
its printed value as modified by Improvement tokens and
Impairment tokens.</p>
		<ul><li>A skill’s value is not affected by bonuses from possessions
or other effects, since those effects are applied only when
resolving a test.</li></ul>
		<p class="example">For example, Rex Murphy has a printed ] of 3 and a single
“+1 ]” Improvement token. As such, his ] value is 4
(3 from its printed value plus 1 from his Improvement token).
The bonus to ] that Rex would gain from the Personal
Assistant Asset does not affect the skill’s value.</p>

		<h3 id="complex-encounters">Complex Encounters</h3>
		<p>Expedition Encounters, Other World Encounters, <span class="sr">Mystic Ruins Encounters</span> and Special
		Encounters are rewarding but dangerous experiences called
		complex encounters. Each of these cards has three effects. To
		resolve these encounters, an investigator first resolves the <span class="def">initial
			effect</span> (the top box of the card). Depending upon the result of
		this effect, he immediately resolves <strong>one</strong> of the other two effects.</p>
		<p>If he passes the <a href="#tests">test</a> in the initial effect, he resolves the card’s
		<span class="def">pass effect</span> in the middle of the card. If he fails the test, he resolves the card’s <span class="def">fail effect</span> at the bottom of the card.
		He resolves the entire effect in the appropriate box (which may
		involve additional tests), then discards the card.</p>

		<section class="example">
			<h3 id="other-world-encounter-example">Other World Encounter Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on a space containing a Gate token
					during the Encounter Phase.</li>
				<li>He decides to encounter the Gate, and draws a card
					from the Other World Encounter deck. He resolves
					the initial effect, and comes upon “(|–1).” This
					means that he needs to test his Observation.</li>
				<li>He takes his investigator’s skill in Observation (3)
					and applies the test’s modifier (–1).</li>
				<li>He does not have any abilities or possessions that
					further modify this value, so he rolls 2 dice.</li>
				<li>He did not roll a “5” or “6” and, therefore, fails
					the test. He resolves the fail effect that causes him
					to lose 3 Sanity unless he spends 1 Clue. He then
					discards the Other World Encounter card.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<h2 id="gaining-possessions-and-conditions">Gaining Possessions and Conditions</h2>
		<p>Investigators frequently gain Assets, Artifacts, <a href="#spells">Spells</a>, and
		Conditions. When an investigator gains a card or token, he
		places it faceup near his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>An investigator can gain a card or token only if it is available.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A card is available if it is in the deck, discard pile, or reserve.</li>
			<li>Cards and tokens on a <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated investigator’s</a> sheet are not
available.</li>

			<li><strong>Gaining a Random Card:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator
				to gain a card (for example, “Gain 1 Artifact”). The investigator
				draws one card from the top of the deck matching the specified
				card type.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#double-sided-cards">Double-sided cards</a> are gained from the bottom of the deck.</li>
				<li>If an investigator gains a <a href="#spells">Spell</a> or Condition that he already has,
					he discards it and draws a replacement, repeating this process
					until he draws a card he does not already have (if able).</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Card with a Specific Trait:</strong> Some effects instruct an
				investigator to gain a card with a specific trait (for example, “Gain
				a <span class="trait">Madness</span> Condition”). The investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> that card type’s
				deck then discard pile for the first card matching the specified trait
				and gains that card. Then he shuffles the deck.
			<ul>
				<li>An investigator that gains a <a href="#spells">Spell</a> or Condition in this way
					searches the deck for the first card matching the specified trait
					he does not already have and gains that card.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Specific Card:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator to
				gain a specific card by name (for example, “Gain an Axe Asset”).
				The investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> that card type’s deck then discard pile
				for the first card matching the specified name and gains that card.
				Then he shuffles the deck.
			<ul>
				<li>If the named card is in the reserve, the investigator gains that
					card instead.</li>
				<li>If the specified card cannot is not found while searching, he does
					not gain a card. For instance, if other investigators or defeated
					investigators possess all copies of the card or all copies of the
					card have been returned to the game box.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Card from the Reserve:</strong> Some effects instruct an
				investigator to gain a card (sometimes with a specific trait) from
				the reserve (for example “Gain 1 <span class="trait">Ally</span> Asset from the reserve”).
				The investigator gains one card <strong>of his choice</strong> that matches the
				specified trait from the reserve.</li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Clue:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator to gain a
				Clue. The investigator takes one random Clue token from the
				<a href="#clue-pool">Clue pool</a>, and places it near his Investigator sheet. When a
				<a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounter</a> card instructs the investigator to “gain this
				clue,” he gains the Clue token from his space.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="search">Search</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator searches for a card, he looks at cards from
the bottom of the deck until he finds a card that matches his
search criteria.</li>
<li>If an investigator does not find a card that matches his search
criteria while searching a deck, he then searches that deck’s
discard pile.</li>
<li>After a deck is searched, the investigator shuffles that deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="possessions">Possessions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>An investigator’s possessions include his Clue tokens, travel ticket
				tokens, Asset cards, Artifact cards, <a href="#spells">Spell</a> cards, and <span class="#mom">Unique Asset</span> cards.</li>
			<li>If an effect does not list a limit, it may be used only once per
instance of the triggered event. For example, if an Asset allows an
investigator to recover 1 additional Health when he performs a
Rest action, he may only use that effect once per Rest action.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="double-sided-cards">Double-Sided Cards</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Double-sided cards of the same type do not share a common back and instead have hidden
		information on the back of their cards.
				They can be identified by the card type under the card’s name.</li>
			<li>When a player gains a double-sided card, he can <strong>only
					look at the front</strong> of the card. The card describes
				when an investigator flips it, at which point
		he immediately resolves the back of the card. When a card is flipped to its front side, do not resolve the
effects on its front.</li>
<li>Decks of double-sided cards remain faceup. Investigators may look
	at the front of the top card of each deck of double-sided cards.</li>
<li>When an investigator draws a random card from a deck of double-
	sided cards, he draws the bottom card.</li>
<li>When a double-sided card is discarded, it is immediately shuffled
	back into its respective deck.</li>
<li>After a player shuffles a deck of double-sided cards, another player
	cuts the deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="spells">Spells</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Spell cards are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided</a>. An investigator <strong>cannot look at the
					back of Spell cards</strong> unless an effect allows him to.</li>
			<li>An investigator can resolve a Spell card’s effect as described on the
				card. A Spell card’s effect may be triggered by a specific event or
				require an action.</li>
			<li>When an investigator resolves a Spell card’s effect, he resolves the
				effects on the front of the card. This may include a test and/or
				flipping the card.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot have multiple copies of the same Spell card.
				If he gains a duplicate Spell card for any reason, he discards the
				newly-gained card.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Condition cards are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided</a>. An investigator <strong>cannot look at
					the back of Conditions</strong> unless an effect allows him to.</li>
<li>Conditions cannot be traded.</li>
<li>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> have multiple copies of the same
Condition. If he would gain a Condition that he already has a
copy of, he does not gain another copy of that Condition.</li>
<li>Some Conditions allow an investigator to perform unique actions
	as described on the card.</li>
<li>If a Condition’s effect does not list a limit, it may only be used
	once per instance of the triggered event.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="lost-in-time-and-space">Lost in Time and Space</h4>
		The Lost in Time and Space Condition affects investigators differently than other
		Conditions. When an investigator gains a Lost in Time and
		Space Condition, he resolves the following effects:
		<ul>
			<li>He removes his Investigator token from the game board.</li>
			<li>He passes the Lead Investigator token to another
				investigator, if able.</li>
			<li>He discards any Detained Condition he has.</li>
		</ul>
		While an investigator has a Lost in Time and Space Condition,
		he follows the rules below:
		<ul>
			<li>He cannot move or perform actions.</li>
			<li>He does not occupy any space on the game board, nor does
				he occupy the same space as tokens or other investigators.
				This includes other investigators that have Lost in Time
				and Space Conditions.</li>
			<li>He is unaffected by effects of Mythos cards, @ effects, or
				any other game effects except those of his Lost in Time and
				Space Condition.</li>
			<li>His Investigator’s passive ability cannot be resolved and
				does not affect other elements of the game.</li>
			<li>He cannot spend resources as a part of a group.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot give the Lead Investigator token
				to another investigator that has a Lost in Time and
				Space Condition.</li>
			<li>If a Lost in Time and Space Condition effect would “spawn
				1 Gate” and there are no Gates in the Gate stack or discard
				pile, he chooses one Gate on the game board instead.</li>
			<li>An investigator that has a Lost in Time and Space
				Condition loses the game if investigators lose the game, and
				he wins the game if investigators win the game.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="unique-assets">Unique Assets</h3>

		<p>Unique Assets are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided cards</a>. An investigator cannot look at
		the back of Unique Assets unless an effect allows him to. There is no limit to the number of Unique
		Assets an investigator can have.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>“Asset” refers to both Assets and Unique Assets. “Non-Unique
				Asset” refers to Assets but not Unique Assets.</li>
			<li>When a Unique Asset is discarded, also discard all
				tokens on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="discarding">Discarding</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>An investigator can discard only his own possessions and
				Condition cards.</li>
			<li>When an effect discards a token from the game board, the active
				investigator discards that token.</li>
			<li>Whenever a card is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard pile
				by its deck.</li>
			<li><a href="#double-sided-cards">Double-sided cards</a>, such as <a href="#spells">Spells</a> or <a href="#conditions">Conditions</a>, are immediately
				shuffled back into their respective decks when discarded.</li>
			<li>When an investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> a deck for a specific card and does not
				find the card he is looking for, he also searches that deck’s discard pile.</li>
			<li>When a deck of cards is empty, immediately shuffle its discard pile
				to form a new deck and have another player cut the deck. The Mythos deck is never replenished.</li>
			<li>When Clue tokens are discarded, they are placed in a faceup discard
				pile near the <a href="#clue-pool">Clue pool</a>. If there are no Clue tokens remaining in the
				Clue pool, place the Clue tokens from the discard pile facedown in
				the Clue pool and randomize them.</li>
			<li>When Gate tokens are discarded, they are placed in a faceup
				discard pile near the <a href="#gate-stack">Gate stack</a>. If there are no Gate tokens
				remaining in the Gate stack, place the Gate tokens from the
				discard pile facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them.</li>
			<li>When Monster tokens are discarded, they are returned to the
				<a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster cup</a>, and the cup is randomized.</li>
			<li>Monsters that have been <a href="#set-aside">set aside</a> during setup are never returned
				to the Monster cup. Instead, they are set aside when discarded.</li>
			<li>All other tokens are returned to the token pool when discarded.</li>
			<li>If an effect forces an investigator to discard a component and he
				does not have enough of that component, he discards all of that
				component instead.</li>
			<li>Components that are not on the game board cannot be discarded
				from the game board. If an effect forces investigators to discard a
				component from the game board and there is not enough of that
				component on the board, they discard all of that
				component instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="spend">Spend</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator spends a token or card, such as a Clue token,
				he discards it in exchange for an effect.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot spend a token or card he does not have.</li>
			<li>An investigator may choose not to spend a token or card he has.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot spend Health or Sanity if doing so would
				cause him to be <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated</a> (i.e., he cannot spend his last Health
				or Sanity).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="delayed-investigators">Delayed Investigators</h2>
		<p>Investigators can become Delayed by various effects. A Delayed
		investigator cannot perform any actions.</p>
		<p>If an investigator would become Delayed on his turn during the Action
Phase, he immediately ends his action and loses all remaining
actions <strong>instead of becoming Delayed</strong>.</p>
		<p>When an investigator becomes Delayed, he tips his Investigator
		token on its side to remember that he is Delayed. Instead of
		performing actions during the Action Phase, he stands up his
		Investigator token and is no longer Delayed.</p>

		<h2 id="health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</h2>
		<p>Each investigator starts the game with Health and Sanity
		tokens equal to his maximum Health and Sanity, respectively.</p>
		<p>When an effect causes an investigator to lose Health or Sanity,
		he discards Health or Sanity tokens from his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>If an investigator <span class="def">recovers</span> Health or Sanity, he gains Health
		and Sanity tokens from the token pool. An investigator cannot
		have more Health or Sanity than his maximum.</p>
		<p>Health or Sanity tokens that are marked with a “3” represent three
single Health or Sanity tokens, respectively. Players may swap a “3”
token for three single tokens or three single tokens for a “3” token
at any time.</p>
		<p>Effects that prevent the loss of Health or Sanity cannot be used
		when an investigator <a href="#spend"><strong>spends</strong></a> Health or Sanity. An investigator cannot spend Health or Sanity if doing so would
cause him to be defeated (i.e., he cannot spend his last Health or
Sanity).</p>
		<h3 id="defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>When an investigator has zero <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health or Sanity</a>, he is
		immediately <span class="def">defeated</span>, stops resolving any encounter or action he is currently resolving, and resolves the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Advance Doom:</strong> Advance Doom by 1.
				<li><strong>Relocation:</strong> Move the Investigator token to the <a href="#nearest">nearest</a>
					City space. Then lay the Investigator token on its side and
					place a Health token on it to indicate the investigator has
					lost all Health, or place a Sanity token on it to indicate the
					investigator has lost all Sanity. If the investigator has lost all <strong>Health and Sanity</strong>, he chooses
either a Health token or a Sanity token to place on his
Investigator token.</li>
				<li><strong>Collect Possessions:</strong> The investigator discards all Condition
					cards, Health, Sanity, and Improvement tokens and places
					his <a href="#possessions">possessions</a> on his Investigator sheet. He places the sheet and
					possessions out of the way; they will be needed if an
					investigator encounters this defeated investigator.</li>
				<li><strong>Pass Lead Investigator:</strong> If the defeated investigator has
					the Lead Investigator token, he must pass the token to an
					investigator of his choice.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>A defeated investigator is not considered an investigator. A
defeated investigator cannot perform actions, resolve effects, or be
affected by effects that affect investigators.</p>
		<p>After resolving the steps above, investigators continue resolving
		the current phase of the game.</p>


		<h3 id="choosing-a-new-investigator">Choosing a New Investigator</h3>
		<p>If an investigator is defeated, the player controlling that
		investigator chooses a new investigator at the end of the Mythos
		Phase. To choose a new investigator, he <strong>chooses any unused
			Investigator and follows <a href="#choose-and-place-investigators">steps 3–4 of setup</a></strong>.
		A player may not
choose an investigator that has been previously defeated during the
same game. If the Ancient One has <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">awoken</a> or the player cannot choose a new investigator because
there are none available, he is <a href="#eliminated-players">eliminated</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="encountering-defeated-investigators">Encountering Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>Investigators may encounter a defeated investigator’s token in
		order to retrieve its possessions and possibly retreat doom.</p>
		<p>If an investigator is on the same space as a defeated
		investigator’s token during the encounter phase, he may resolve
		one of the encounters on the back of the defeated investigator’s
		sheet. He resolves the “Crippled” encounter if the Investigator
		token has a Health token on it or the “Insane” encounter if the
		Investigator token has a Sanity token on it.</p>
		<p>After resolving this encounter, remove the defeated Investigator
		token and Investigator sheet from the game. That investigator
		cannot be used for the remainder of the game.</p>
		<h3 id="devoured-investigators">Devoured Investigators</h3>
		<p>Some game effects cause investigators to be devoured. When
		an investigator is devoured, he is considered defeated but only
		follows steps <strong>1 and 4</strong> of <a href="#defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</a>.
		He then discards all Conditions, possessions, Health, Sanity,
		and Improvement tokens and returns his Investigator sheet
		and token to the game box. At the end of the Mythos Phase, he
		<a href="#choosing-a-new-investigator">chooses a new investigator</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="combat-encounter">Combat Encounter</h2>

		<p>Resolving Combat Encounters is the main way in which
		investigators can defeat <a href="#spawning-monsters">Monsters</a> to remove them from the
		game board.</p>

		<p>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on a space containing
		one or more Monsters must encounter each Monster on his space, one at a
		time, in the order of his choice, <span class="fl">encountering all non-Epic Monsters
			before Epic Monsters</span>. An investigator resolves a Combat Encounter by
		following these steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Check Monster Effects:</strong> The Monster might have effects that alter how
				the investigator resolves the combat. Flip the
				Monster token facedown and read the information on the
				back of the token before resolving any other part of the Combat Encounter.</li>
			<li><strong>Resolve Will Test:</strong> The investigator resolves the Will ({) <a href="#tests">test</a> listed on the
		Monster token.
			<ul>
				<li>If the Monster’s <span class="def">horror</span> (the number next to the Sanity icon) is greater than the test result, the
					investigator loses Sanity equal to the difference.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Resolve Strength Test:</strong> The investigator resolves the Strength (}) <a href="#tests">test</a> listed on the
		Monster token.
			<ul>
				<li>If the Monster’s <span class="def">damage</span> (the number next to the Health icon) is greater than the test result, the
					investigator loses Health equal to the difference.</li>
				<li>If he passes, the Monster loses Health equal to the test result.
					Indicate this by placing a equal number of Health tokens on
					the Monster token. The investigator and Monster lose
					Health simultaneously.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ol>

		<ul>
			<li class="fl">Some Monsters require the player to test
skills other than { and }. If a Monster has another skill icon in place of either the {
or } test indicators, the player tests the indicated skill in
place of the skill it replaced.</li>
			<li>When a Monster has lost Health equal to or greater than its
				toughness, the Monster is defeated and returned to the monster cup.</li>
			<li>If a Monster does not have a { or } test, the investigator does
				not resolve that test.</li>
			<li>If an investigator defeats every Monster on his space during the
				Encounter Phase, he may resolve an additional encounter of
				his choice.</li>
		<li>If the investigator did not defeat the Monster, it remains on his
		space along with any Health tokens on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="magical-resistance">Magical Resistance</h3>

		<p class="mom">When resolving a Combat
		Encounter against a Monster with the Magical Resistance
		ability, an investigator cannot apply any bonus to his die
		pool from <span class="trait">Magical</span> possessions or Spells.
		Effects that allow the investigator to reroll dice or manipulate
		dice results can be used as normal.

		<h3 id="physical-resistance">Physical Resistance</h3>
		<p class="mom">When resolving a Combat
		Encounter against a Monster with the Physical Resistance
		ability, an investigator cannot apply any bonus to his die

				<li>Lily resolves a { test. She has a { of 3. The Monster
					does not list a modifier, so she rolls 3 dice.</li>
				<li>She rolls 1 success and subtracts it from the Monster’s
					horror ( ) of 2. She loses 1 Sanity (equal to the
					difference).</li>
				<li>Lily resolves a } test. She has a } of 4. She applies
					the Monster’s modifier (–1) and gains a bonus from her
					“.38 Revolver” (+2), so she rolls 5 dice.</li>
				<li>She rolls 1 success, and subtracts it from the Monster’s
					damage ( ) of 1. Since she rolled a number of successes
					equal to its damage, she does not lose any Health.
					Since she rolled 1 success, the Monster loses 1 Health.
					She places 1 Health token on the Monster. Its toughness
					is 2, so it is not defeated and her encounter ends.</li>

		</section>

		<h2 id="epic-monsters">Epic Monsters</h2>
		<p>Some Monsters are so powerful or
		unmanageable that they are immune to
		some effects. Epic Monsters are treated like
		Monsters for all effects except for the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be defeated unless it has lost Health equal
		to or greater than its toughness, at which point it is returned to the game box.</li>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be discarded.</li>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be moved, except by an effect on its
				token or the component that spawned it.</li>
			<li>Epic Monsters are never placed in the Monster cup and are spawned by specific effects that call them out
		by name.</li>
			<li>When an Epic Monster is defeated, it is returned to the game box.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>“Monster” refers to a Monster and/or an Epic Monsters. “Non-Epic Monster” refers to a Monster but not an Epic Monster.</p>

		<h2 id="ambush">Ambush</h2>
		<p>Some effects cause investigators to encounter Monsters that
		are not on the game board. When an effect says “A Monster
		ambushes you,” the investigator draws one random Monster
		from the Monster cup and immediately encounters it in
		<a href="#combat-encounter">combat</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The Monster is not spawned. If it has a “when spawned” effect, do
				not resolve that effect.</li>
<li>After resolving the Combat Encounter, the Monster is discarded
	even if it was not defeated, and the investigator continues
		resolving the effect that caused the ambush.</li>
<li>If a <strong>specific</strong> Monster ambushes an investigator, do not draw a
Monster token. Instead, reference the Monster’s attributes from a
token that has been set aside or is on the game board.</li>
<li>If a <a href="#cultists">Cultist</a> Monster ambushes an investigator, do not draw a
Monster token. Instead, reference the Cultist information on the

		<h2 id="adventures">Adventures</h2>

		<p>Adventures are used only if specifically mentioned by another game
		componet such as the Ancient One sheet or Prelude card.</p>

		<p>When an Adventure is drawn, the active investigator places
it faceup in play and resolves that card’s “when this card
enters play” effect.</p>
		<p>Each Adventure has an effect that allows investigators to
complete the Adventure. When an Adventure is completed,
the active investigator resolves that card’s “when this Adventure
is completed” effect, which often includes drawing another
Adventure representing the next chapter of the story. Then the
active investigator discards the Adventure, any tokens on it, and
any tokens placed by its effects.</p>

		<h2 id="rumors">Rumors</h2>
		<p><span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards often place Rumor

			<p>Some effects found on <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards and
			Mysteries place tokens on a “random space.” Whenever
			an effect refers to a random space, that space is
			determined by drawing one Clue token from the Clue

			token. The drawn Clue token is then discarded.</p>
			<p>If there are no Clue tokens remaining in the Clue pool or discard
			pile, the Lead Investigator chooses a space instead.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="mysteries">Mysteries</h2>
		<p>In order to win the game, investigators need to solve a number of
		Mysteries as indicated on the Ancient One sheet. Each Ancient One has its own deck of Mystery cards
		with a unique set of tasks that the investigators must resolve.</p>
		<p>During setup, draw one Mystery card and place it faceup next
		to the Ancient One sheet. Each card lists how investigators can
		solve that Mystery.</p>

		<p>“Active Mystery” refers to the faceup Mystery card in play that has
not yet been solved. When the active Mystery is solved or removed from play, discard
all tokens on it or placed by it. Then draw a new Mystery, placing
it <strong>on top of</strong> any solved Mysteries.</p>

		<p>As soon as investigators solve the number of Mysteries indicated on the front of the Ancient One sheet, investigators win the
		game. If the Ancient One awakens, investigators additionally need to solve
		the <a href="#final-mystery">Final Mystery</a>.</p>

		<p>If a solved Mystery is shuffled into the deck or returned to the
game box, that Mystery no longer counts as a solved Mystery.</p>

		<h3 id="advancing-the-active-mystery">Advancing the Active Mystery</h3>

		<p>Some game effects “advance the active
		Mystery.” Due to the complexity of Mysteries, this can result in
		a number of different effects. When investigators are instructed
		to advance the active Mystery, the active investigator resolves
		one of the following effects that applies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the active Mystery requires one or more tokens to be placed
				on the card, place one token of that type on the card.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Clues, Gates, and Monsters placed on the active Mystery
					in this way are drawn from the Clue pool, Gate stack, and
					Monster cup, respectively.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>If the active Mystery requires an Epic Monster to be defeated,
				place two Health on the card. The Epic Monster’s toughness
				is reduced by one for each Health on the active Mystery.</li>
			<li>If the active Mystery requires an investigator to spend one
				or more Clues, place one Clue from the Clue pool on the
				card. Any investigator may spend Clues placed on the active
				Mystery when resolving an effect of that card.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="the-ancient-one-awakens">The Ancient One Awakens</h2>
		<p>When the Doom token reaches the “0” space of the Doom
		track, the Ancient One <span class="def">awakens</span>. Flip the Ancient One sheet and
		immediately resolve the “Awakens” effects (if any) on the upper-
		left corner of the sheet. This sheet remains facedown for the rest
		of the game, and its effects replace those found on the front of the
		sheet (including Cultist information). The back of the Ancient
		One sheet describes how the investigators can lose the game and describes the <a href="#final-mystery">Final Mystery</a> which the investigators must complete in
	addition to the other <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p id="awaken-doom">After the Ancient One awakens, Doom cannot retreat. The

		<h3 id="eliminated-players">Eliminated Players</h3>
		<p>After the Ancient One has awakened, when an investigator is
		defeated or devoured, the player controlling that investigator is
		<span class="def">eliminated</span>. Eliminated players do not select a new investigator
		to control and can no longer participate in the game.</p>
		<p>If all players are eliminated, investigators lose the game.</p>
		<p>If the investigators win the game, any eliminated players win as well.</p>
		<h3 id="final-mystery">Final Mystery</h3>
		<p>Once the Ancient One awakens, it is much more difficult

	<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

	<p>This section lists clarification to commonly overlooked rules and
	complex investigator abilities.</p>
<p class="q">If I use an effect that applies to “investigators,” does this include myself?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Unless the effect says “other investigators,” it affects all
investigators, including the one who is using the effect.</p>
<p class="q">Can I use an ability that lets me roll “additional” dice after I’ve already
rolled for a test?</p>
<p class="a">No. When you resolve a test, you must declare any additional dice
you wish to roll before rolling any dice.</p>
<p class="q">Can I use multiple weapons during combat?</p>
<p class="a">Yes, but you can only apply the highest bonus to a test. However,
you may use any other effects, from your other weapons. For example,
if you have a Bull Whip Asset and a .45 Automatic Asset, you may
apply the +3 bonus from the .45 to your } instead of the +1 bonus
from the whip, and you may still reroll one die by using the whip’s
other effect.</p>
<p class="q">Is every roll considered a test?</p>
<p class="a">No. An effect that tells you to roll a specific number of dice (such
as the @ effect on a Cursed Condition) is not a test. These rolls cannot
be rerolled or modified by effects that affect tests.</p>
<p class="q">When an investigator is defeated, can the newly chosen investigator be
given the Lead Investigator token at the end of the Mythos Phase?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Both choosing a new investigator and passing the Lead
Investigator token occur “at the end of the Mythos Phase.” The Lead
Investigator chooses the order to resolve effects that occur at the
same time, so a new investigator can be chosen, and then the Lead
Investigator token can be passed to him.</p>
<p class="q">Can I resolve an “as an encounter” effect if there is a Monster on my
space?</p>
<p class="a">No. Effects that say “as an encounter” are treated just like any other
encounter option available to you. If there is a Monster on your space,
you must encounter the Monster. However, if you defeat the Monster
and there are no other Monsters on your space, your additional
encounter can be to resolve that effect.</p>
<p>If an effect says “instead of resolving an encounter,” (such as the
Detained Condition), this can be resolved even on a space containing
a Monster.</p>
<p class="q">Are effects that say “or,” “may,” or “unless” optional?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Effects using those words offer you a choice. If an effect says,
“may,” it is giving you an option which you choose to resolve or not.
<p>If an effect says, “or,” it is giving you two or more options to choose
from.</p>
<p>If an effect says, “unless,” is it giving you an option to resolve the effect
following “unless.” However, if you choose not to resolve that effect,
you must resolve the effect preceding “unless” instead.</p>
<p class="q fl">Does an investigator recover additional Health and Sanity from
effects, such as the Healing Words Spell or Witch Doctor Asset, if he
has a Poisoned Condition?<p>
<p class="a">No, an investigator with a Poisoned Condition does not
recover Health and Sanity from a Rest action nor does he
recover additional Health and Sanity from other effects
during a Rest action.</p>
<p>However, other effects that cause an investigator to recover
Health or Sanity without performing a Rest action, such as the
Private Care Asset, affect that investigator as normal.</p>
<p class="q fl">Can an investigator with a Lost in Time and Space Condition
be moved by another investigator using the Plumb the Void Spell?</p>
<p class="a">No, an investigator who has a Lost in Time and Space
Condition (or a Detained Condition) “cannot move.” This
means he cannot move on his own nor be moved by any other
effect, including the Plumb the Void Spell.</p>

<p class="q mom">What space type are spaces on the Antarctica side board?</p>
<p class="a">The spaces on the Antarctica side board do not have a
space type. When an investigator encounters a Clue on the
Antarctica side board, he draws and resolves an Antarctica
Research Encounter.</p>
<p class="q mom">Are two spaces connected by a Local path adjacent?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Two spaces connected by a Local path are adjacent.</p>
<p class="q mom">How does the Blunderbuss Asset’s effect work?</p>
<p class="a">Similar to the Double-barreled Shotgun, an investigator
with the Blunderbuss gets two successes for each 6 he rolls
when resolving a } test during a Combat Encounter.
However, for each 1 he rolls during that test he negates one
success. This means that when calculating his total successes,
he subtracts one from the test result for each 1 he rolled to a
minimum of zero successes.</p>

<p class="q mom">Can an investigator have multiple copies of the same
Unique Asset?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. There is no limit to the number of Unique Assets an
investigator can have.</p>
<p class="q mom">Can an investigator gain a random Unique Asset when told to
gain a random Asset?</p>
<p class="a">No. If an effect says, “gain 1 random Asset from the deck,”
the investigator gains the Asset from the Asset deck, not the
Unique Asset deck. An investigator gains a Unique Asset only
if the effect specifically calls for a Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q mom">Can investigators trade Task Assets?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. <span class="trait">Task</span> Assets, like other Assets, may be traded using the
Trade action. If a <span class="trait">Task</span> Asset has one or more tokens on it,
those tokens remain on the card when traded.</p>
<p class="q mom">What happens if an investigator gains a Courier Run Unique
Asset and there are no Clues in the Clue pool that correspond to
City spaces?</p>
<p class="a">The investigator should discard the Clue on the nearest
City space containing a Clue, placing that Clue faceup on his
Courier Run Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q mom">Can an investigator benefit from both the Storm of Spirits Spell
and a Weapon Asset?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Storm of Spirits Spell allows an investigator to
resolve a [ test in place of the } test during a Combat
Encounter. If he does, bonuses to his } do not apply to
the [ test. However, bonuses to the investigator’s [ apply
to the test.</p>
<p class="q mom">When can an investigator discard a Debt Condition with a
Funding Condition?</p>
<p class="a">If an investigator would gain a Debt Condition and he
already has a Funding Condition, he may discard the Funding
Condition instead of gaining the Debt Condition.</p>
<p>If an investigator has both a Debt Condition and a Funding
Condition, he may discard both cards at any time.</p>
<p class="q mom">Does an investigator recover additional Health from effects,
such as the Provisions Unique Asset, if he has a Hypothermia or
Infection Condition?</p>
<p class="a">No. An investigator with a Hypothermia or Infection
Condition does not recover Health from a Rest action nor
does he recover additional Health from other effects during
a Rest action.</p>
<p>However, effects that cause an investigator to recover Health
without performing a Rest action, such as the Private Care
Asset, affect that investigator as normal.</p>

<p class="q sr">When an investigator moves to another space using the Kopesh
of the Abyss Artifact’s effect, does that investigator encounter the
Monsters on his new space?</p>
<p class="a sr">No. The investigator will encounter each Monster on his
space. Then, if he defeats all Monsters on his space, he may
move to the nearest space containing a Monster. He will not
encounter those Monsters in the same round. If he remains on
that space until the Encounter Phase, he will then encounter
each Monster on that space as normal.</p>
<p class="q sr">If an investigator discards a Relic Unique Asset as a part of its
flip effect, can he still place an Eldritch token on the Relics of the
Ancient World Mystery?</p>
<p class="a sr">Yes. The Mystery gives the investigator the option to both
place an Eldritch token on the Mystery and discard the ReliC
Unique Asset. The investigator may choose to resolve this effect
even if he can resolve only part of the full effect.</p>
<p class="q sr">What happens if an effect would cause the Omen to advance to
the red space while it is already on that space?</p>
<p class="a sr">“Advance the Omen to the red space of the Omen track”
means to advance the Omen until it is on the red space. If the
Omen starts on the red space, it will advance four times in total
and return to the red space of the Omen track.
If Syzygy is the Ancient One, this will trigger its “When the
Omen advances to the red space of the Omen track” effect.</p>
<p class="q sr">When playing against Syzygy, do investigators need to solve two
Mysteries to win the game?</p>
<p class="a sr">No. When the Syzygy Ancient One sheet is flipped, one
Clue will be placed on the Ancient One sheet for each solved
Mystery. However, the Sealing the Portal Special Encounters
will also place Clues on the Ancient One sheet.
Solving the Mysteries is not required to attempt the Special
Encounters or win the game. However, solving Mysteries
greatly reduces the difficulty of the Final Mystery.</p>
<p class="q sr">Does the Crystal of the Elder Things Artifact from the Forsaken
Lore expansion negate the Health loss from the Out of the Aeons
Mythos card?</p>
<p class="a sr">Yes. An investigator with the Crystal of the Elder Things
Artifact cannot lose Health or Sanity from Mythos card text
effects even if that Health or Sanity loss cannot be prevented.
The Crystal does not create a prevention effect that “prevents”
the loss of Health or Sanity if it would occur. Instead, it
prohibits Mythos card text effects from causing the
investigator to lose Health or Sanity.</p>
<p class="q utp">If an investigator defeats a Cultist Monster as part of a Spawn
of Abhoth Special Encounter during the Encounter Phase, can he
resolve another encounter?</p>
<p class="a utp">Yes. Spawn of Abhoth Special Encounters are considered
Combat Encounters. If an investigator defeats every Monster
on his space during the Encounter Phase, he may resolve an
additional encounter of his choice.</p>

<p class="q utp">If an investigator with a Record of Knowledge Unique Asset
gains more than one Clue during a Research Encounter, can he
place multiple Eldritch tokens on his task?</p>
<p class="a utp">Yes. An investigator places one Eldritch token on a Record
of Knowledge Unique Asset for each Clue he gains as part of a
Research Encounter.
However, Clues gained from other effects, such as Mandy
Thompson’s passive ability, are not gained as part of the
Research Encounter and do not allow the investigator to place
an Eldritch token on the Record of Knowledge Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q utp">What happens if an investigator gains a Treasure Map Unique
Asset and there are no Clues in the Clue pool?</p>
<p class="a utp">The investigator should discard the Clue on the nearest
space containing a Clue, placing that Clue faceup on his
Treasure Map Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q utp">Does an investigator recover additional Sanity from effects,
such as the Psychoanalyst Asset, if he has a Despair Condition?</p>
<p class="a utp">No. An investigator with a Despair Condition does not
recover Sanity from a Rest action nor does he recover additional
Sanity from other effects during a Rest action.
However, effects that cause an investigator to recover Sanity
without performing a Rest action, such as the Private Care
Asset, affect that investigator as normal.

<p class="q soc">Does the Spawn of Hastur Epic Monster’s ability prevent it from
losing two or more Health during a Combat Encounter?</p>
<p class="a soc">Yes. If any effect, including the effects of a Combat
Encounter, would cause the Spawn of Hastur Epic Monster
to lose two or more Health, it loses one Health instead.</p>

<h2 id="optional-rules">Optional Rules</h2>

<p>Some players may wish to adjust the game’s difficulty or keep score in
order to compare their success across multiple games. This section lists
optional rules for adjusting the game’s difficulty and length or keeping
score.</p>

<h3 id="adjusting-game-difficulty">Adjusting Game Difficulty</h3>

<p>Some groups may find Eldritch Horror too easy or too challenging. If
all players agree at the start of the game, they can make the game easier
or harder as listed below.</p>

<h4 id="mythos-deck">Mythos Deck</h4>
<p>Players can alter the game’s difficulty when building the Mythos deck.</p>
<p>Players can make the game easier by returning all hard Mythos cards
(with red tentacles) to the game box before building the Mythos deck.</p>
<p>Likewise, players can make the game harder by returning all easy Mythos
cards (with a blue sigil) to the game box before building the Mythos deck.</p>

<h4 id="insane-game-difficulty">Insane Game Difficulty</h4>
<p>If players wish to have an even more challenging game experience, they can make
the game significantly more difficult by building the Mythos
deck using only hard Mythos cards.</p>
<p>Note—This optional rule may require several expansions
depending on the chosen Ancient One.</p>

<h4 id="starting-rumor">Starting Rumor</h4>
<p>If players want a greater challenge, they may choose to begin the game
with one starting <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card. After setup, draw one unused
	<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card from the game box and place it in play. Resolve
any “When this card enters play,” effects, as well as the Place Rumor
Token icon (if it appears on the card). Do not spawn Clues from the
Rumor’s Spawn Clues icon.</p>

<h4 id="staged-difficulty">Staged Difficulty</h4>
<p>Players can make the game’s difficulty increase in stages by
building stage I of the Mythos deck using only easy Mythos
cards, building stage II of the Mythos deck using only normal
Mythos cards, and building stage III of the Mythos deck using
only hard Mythos cards.</p>
<ul><li>
To increase the difficulty of this optional rule, players can
use normal blue Mythos cards when building stage I of the
Mythos deck and hard blue Mythos cards when building
stage II of the Mythos deck. Players may also start with
an easy blue Mythos card in play following the <a href="#starting-rumor">Starting
	Rumor</a> rule.</li></ul>

<h4 id="control-your-fate">Control Your Fate</h4>
<p class="mom">Instead of drawing a random Prelude card before setup,
players as a group may choose one Prelude card, following
the card’s effects as normal.</p>
<p>Alternatively, players may choose to not use a Prelude card.</p>

<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
<p>If investigators win the game, they can determine how well they did
and record this score on a sheet of paper along with the Ancient One
and any optional rules used. The lower the score, the better!
To calculate a score, start with zero, then:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add one for each Gate on the game board.</li>
	<li>Add one for every three Monsters on the game board (rounded up).</li>
	<li>Add one for each Cursed or Dark Pact Condition investigators have.</li>
	<li>Add three for each <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card in play.</li>
	<li>Subtract one for every three Clue tokens investigators have
		(rounded up).</li>
	<li>Subtract one for each Blessed Condition investigators have.</li>
	<li>Subtract the current level of Doom.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solo-game">Solo Game</h3>
<p>To play a single player game of Eldritch Horror, follow all of the
normal rules while using a single investigator. During setup for a single
investigator game, return all components with the <span class="trait">Teamwork</span> trait to
the game box.</p>
<p>For a slightly more dynamic game, the player can choose to control
two investigators instead of one. In this situation, choose two
investigators during setup and use the two-player Reference card.
Treat each investigator as if it were being controlled by a different
player. For example, one investigator is the Lead Investigator and they
take separate turns during the Action Phase and Encounter Phase.</p>
