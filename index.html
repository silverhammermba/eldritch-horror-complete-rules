			<h3 id="using-this-rulebook">Using this Rulebook</h3>

			<p>The official rulebook is still the recommended way to learn the
			game. This document is intended as a definitive resource combining
			all official rules for all expansions, reference guides, FAQs, and
			errata, such that all questions can be clarified by searching one
			document.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h2>

		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is a cooperative game of investigation and
		horror inspired by the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. In each
		game, one of the Ancient Ones, a being of unimaginable power
		that predates time itself, is awakening. Players take on the roles
		of investigators who are attempting to solve mysteries, defend
		humanity from unimaginable horrors, and ultimately banish
		the Ancient One from this world. If investigators fail at their
		task, the Ancient One awakens, and mankind is doomed.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="players-and-investigators">Players and Investigators</h3>

			<p>When playing <em>Eldritch Horror</em>, each player controls an
			investigator. The word “investigator” refers to a player, the in-game character he controls,
and that character’s Investigator sheet and Investigator token. </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3 id="the-golden-rules">The Golden Rules</h3>
<p>Effects on components (such as cards) sometimes contradict
this rulebook. In this
situation, the component’s effect overrules this rulebook.</p>
<p>Restrictive effects on cards are absolute. For example, an
investigator’s Detained Condition says, “You <strong>cannot</strong> move.” That
investigator cannot move or be moved by any action or effect.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3 id="using-expansions">Using Expansions</h3>

			<p>When playing with expansions, add
all expansion components to their respective decks or
pools of Eldritch Horror components. Unless otherwise
instructed, use all components when
playing with expansions.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

		<p>Before playing each game, perform the following steps in order.</p>

		<h3 id="personal-stories">0. Personal Stories</h3>
		<p class="mon">Personal stories represent
		the continuing stories your investigator faces as the game
		progresses. Personal stories can be used during any game.</p>
		<p>Players decide if they would like to
		play with personal stories or not. Either all players play with
		personal stories or all players play without.</p>

		<h3 id="determine-prelude">0.5. Determine Prelude</h3>

		<p class="mom">Draw one random Prelude card before setting up the game. These cards
		alter game setup and make each game feel unique. The card’s effect is
		resolved immediately after drawing the card, unless it specifies
		different timing, such as “after resolving setup.”</p>

		<p>Some expansions include duplicate Preludes which originally appeared
		in previous expansions. If playing with those expansions, do not
		include the duplicate Preludes in the Prelude deck.</p>

		<h3 id="place-game-board">1. Place Game Board</h3>
		<p>Unfold the game board and place it in the center of the play
		area within easy reach of all players.</p>

		<h4 id="side-board-setup">1.5 Side Board Setup</h4>

		<p class="mom">Side boards are only set up when specifically mentioned
		by game components such as the Ancient One sheet or Prelude card.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Place side board:</strong>
				Unfold the side board and place it near the main board within
				reach of all players.</li>
			<li><strong>Add clues and gates:</strong>
				Add the Clues and Gates that correspond to spaces
				on the side board when constructing the Clue pool and Gate stack, respectively,
				and randomize the Clue pool and Gate stack.</li>
			<li><strong>Set aside monsters:</strong>
				<a href="#set-aside">Set aside</a> Monsters from the Monster cup as indicated on the side board.</li>
			<li><strong>Separate and place decks:</strong>
				Separate all Encounter cards related to the side board into decks and shuffle each
				deck. Place these decks near the side board.</li>
			<li class="td"><strong>Spawn Dream Portals:</strong>
				When setting up the Dreamlands side board, <a href="#dream-portals">spawn all three Dream Portals</a>.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>While side boards are in play, “game board” refers to both
the main board included in Eldritch Horror and the side boards.
“Side board” always refers to a side board and not the main board.</p>

		<h3 id="organize-tokens">2. Organize Tokens</h3>
		<p>Organize the following tokens as listed below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li id="gate-stack">Create the <a href="#what-are-gates">Gate</a> stack by randomizing the Gate tokens,
				and placing them facedown (common side up) in a stack
				within reach of all players.
			<ul>
				<li>Gates are kept facedown in the Gate stack until they are spawned.</li>
				<li>When a Gate is closed, it is discarded.</li>
						<li>When a Gate is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard pile
near the Gate stack until the Gate stack is empty. When there are
no Gates remaining in the Gate stack, place all discarded Gates
facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li id="clue-pool">Create the <a href="#what-are-clues">Clue</a> pool by placing the Clue tokens facedown
				(common side up) in a pile within reach of all players and
				randomize them.
			<ul>
				<li>Clues are kept facedown in the Clue pool until they are spawned,
					discarded, or gained by investigators.</li>
<li>When a Clue token is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard
pile near the Clue pool until the Clue pool is empty. When there
are no Clue tokens remaining in the Clue pool, place all discarded
Clue tokens facedown in the Clue pool and randomize them.</li>
<li>When an effect spawns a Clue, draw one random Clue token from
the Clue pool and place it on the space indicated on the front of
that token.</li>
<li>When an effect spawns a Clue on a specific space, draw one Clue
token from the Clue pool and place it on the space specified by the
effect. The space indicated on the front of the Clue token is not
referenced.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Create the general token pool by taking all Health, Sanity,
				Improvement, Impairment, Travel Ticket, Eldritch, Mystery, Rumor, Adventure, <span class="cir">Devastation</span>, <span class="mom">Focus</span>, and <span class="mon">Resource</span> tokens and place them in piles
				within reach of all players. These tokens are always
				available. If the general token pool has no remaining tokens of any one type,
				track those tokens on paper or with a small object such as a coin.
			<ul>
				<li>Eldritch tokens are a generic resource used by many effects,
					including the Ancient One.</li>
				<li>A component that places an Eldritch token on the game board
					describes how investigators interact with that token.</li>
				<li class="mon">Some effects (notably the Corruption
Condition) cause you to gain Eldritch tokens. Eldritch tokens
you have gained represent your current level of corruption.
When you gain an Eldritch token, place that token on your
Investigator sheet. Some effects allow you to spend or discard
your Eldritch tokens.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="choose-and-place-investigators">3. Choose and Place Investigators</h3>
		<p>Players agree upon one player to receive the Lead Investigator
		token. If they cannot decide, players assign this token to a
		random player as they see fit (for example, by rolling a die).
		Starting with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise,
		each player chooses one investigator. He takes the corresponding
		Investigator sheet, then places the matching Investigator token on
		the game board space listed on the back of his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Each Investigator sheet has an action ability that the investigator
may perform during the Action Phase and a passive ability that
affect how he and other investigators interact with the game.</li>
<li>Each Investigator sheet lists the investigator’s maximum Health
and Sanity and five skills: Lore (<span class="lore"></span>), Influence (<span class="influence"></span>),
Observation (<span class="observation"></span>), Strength (<span class="strength"></span>), and Will (<span class="will"></span>).</li>
<li><p>The back of each Investigator sheet indicates the investigator’s
starting location, including a map for reference, and his starting
possessions, Conditions, and effects.</p>
	<p>It also indicates the investigator’s defeated investigator encounters,
	including a Crippled effect and an Insane effect.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="receive-starting-possessions-health-and-sanity">4. Receive Starting Possessions, Health, and Sanity</h3>
		<p>Each investigator receives the starting possessions listed on the back
		of his Investigator sheet. He gains any Assets or
		Spells listed by taking the matching card from the game box.
		Then he takes a number of <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</a> tokens equal to
		his investigator’s maximum Health and Sanity listed on the
		front of his Investigator sheet. He places these tokens near his Investigator sheet.</p>

		<p class="mon">If playing with personal stories, each investigator also receives the
		Personal Mission card that corresponds
		to their chosen investigator, placing it
		near their Investigator sheet with their
		possessions.</p>
		<p>Your Personal Mission includes
		additional narrative text as well as an
		effect that causes you to gain your
		Reward or Consequence.</p>
		<p>When you gain your Reward or Consequence,
		place it near your Investigator sheet
		with your possessions. You can gain your
		Reward or Consequence, but not both.
		Once you gain your Reward or
		Consequence, you keep it until the end
		of the game. Personal Missions, Rewards,
		and Consequences cannot be discarded
		by other game effects.</p>
		<p>Although Reward/Consequence cards act similarly to Assets
		or Conditions, they are not possessions or Conditions and
		are not affected by effects that affect other card types.</p>

		<h3 id="determine-ancient-one">5. Determine Ancient One</h3>
		<p>As a group, players choose one of the Ancient One sheets. Each
		Ancient One provides a different game experience. For their first
		game, it is recommended players choose “Azathoth,” as he is the
		most straightforward Ancient One. Place the chosen sheet faceup
		(displaying a <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">Doom</a> value in the top
		left corner) near the game board and
		<strong>resolve any setup effects on the sheet</strong>.

		<ul>
			<li>The chosen Ancient One sheet determines the
				Ancient One for the entire game.</li>
<li>The Ancient One’s illustration is featured on the back of the
	<a href="#special-encounters">Special Encounters</a>, <a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounters</a>, and <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a> that
correspond to it.</li>
<li>The Ancient One’s effects may set aside Monster tokens or other
	components.</li>
<li>The Ancient One sheet defines the specific information of <a href="#cultists">Cultist</a>
	Monsters.</li>
<li>When the Ancient One <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">awakens</a>, flip the sheet and resolve its
	“awakens” effects, if any.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Related Topics: <a href="#phase-mythos-phase">Mythos</a>, <a href="#set-aside">Set Aside</a></p>

		<h3 id="create-monster-cup">6. Create <a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster Cup</a></h3>
		<p>Take all non-epic, non-set-aside Monster tokens and place them in an opaque
		container such as a bowl, mug, or the cover of the game box
		(not shown in setup diagram). Then shake this container to
		randomize the Monster tokens.
		<p><strong>Do not place the <a href="#epic-monsters">Epic Monster</a> tokens in the Monster cup</strong>.
		Epic Monster tokens are marked by their red color and clipped
		lower-left corner.

		<h3 id="separate-and-place-decks">7. Separate and Place Decks</h3>
		<p>Take all Research Encounter cards, Special Encounter cards,
		and Mystery cards that do not correspond to the chosen
		Ancient One and return them to the game box. Those cards will not be used for this game.

		<section>
			<h3 id="ancient-one-specific-cards">Ancient One Specific Cards</h3>
			<p>Each Ancient One has at least two unique decks of cards: the
			Mystery deck and the Research deck. Some Ancient Ones
			also have Special Encounter decks called out in their
			setup effect.</p>
			<p id="special-encounters">The illustrations on the back of each Special Encounter indicates
the Ancient One and the Mystery or Final Mystery it corresponds
to. Special Encounter cards also share their title with the Mystery
or Final Mystery they correspond to.</p>
			<p>The instructions for resolving Special Encounters are defined by the
			Ancient One sheet or Mystery cards.</p>
		</section>

		<p>Then separate all other cards as listed below and place them
		near the game board.</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="expedition-deck">Shuffle all <a href="#complex-encounters">Expedition</a> Encounter cards into a single deck,
				regardless of card back.</li>
			<li>Shuffle the Spell cards, Condition cards, and <span class="mom"><a href="#unique-assets">Unique Asset</a> cards</span> into
				separate decks. Place these decks faceup, with the top
				card’s name and artwork visible.</li>
			<li class="sr">The Mystic Ruins Encounter deck is only set up when
				specifically mentioned by another component such as the Ancient
				One or Prelude, otherwise return those cards to the game
			box.</li>
			<li class="td">The <a href="#dream-quest">Dream-Quest Encounter</a> deck is only set up when using the Dreamlands side board.</li>
			<li class="cir">Shuffle the Disasters and Devastation Encounters to create
their two respective decks. Place the Disaster deck facedown
with the Mythos deck and the Devastation Encounter
deck facedown with the other encounter decks.</li>
			<li>Set the Mythos cards aside for step 8. Then separate all
				other cards into decks by card back and shuffle each deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="build-mythos-deck">8. Build Mythos Deck</h3>

		<p>The Mythos deck is built differently each game, based on the
		instructions on the bottom of the Ancient One sheet. To build this deck,
		perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Separate all Mythos cards into three piles, based upon
				the color on the front of the card (green, yellow, and
				blue). Shuffle each separately, and place them facedown.</li>
			<li>Build stage I of the Mythos deck by taking random
				cards of the denoted colors and quantities (listed at the
				bottom of the Ancient One sheet) and shuffling them
				together. Do not look at the cards at this time.</li>
			<li>Then build stage II of the Mythos deck (following the
				same steps as stage I) and place it <strong>under</strong> the stage I deck.</li>
			<li>Finally, build stage III of the Mythos deck and place
				it <strong>under</strong> the stage II deck to create a single Mythos
				deck. Once created, <strong>do not shuffle this deck</strong>. Place the
				deck near the Ancient One sheet. Return all remaining
				Mythos cards to the game box without looking at them.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="resolve-starting-effects">9. Resolve Starting Effects</h3>
		<p>Resolve the following effects to complete setup:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the Reference card that corresponds to
				the number of players near the Mythos deck.
				Players use the Reference card when resolving
				Mythos effects. Return all other Reference
				cards to the game box.</li>
			<li>Place the Doom token on the space of the
				Doom track listed on the upper-left corner of
				the Ancient One sheet. For example, the
				Azathoth sheet denotes that the Doom token
				starts on the “15” space of the Doom track.</li>
			<li>Place the Omen token on the green (comet)
				space of the Omen track.</li>
			<li id="reserve">Place the top four cards of the Asset deck faceup in the four
				slots of the reserve (at the bottom-left of the game board). Whenever a card is gained or discarded from the reserve, the active
investigator places the top card from the Asset deck faceup in its
place except during an <a href="#acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets</a> action.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Gates indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Gate, take the top Gate token from the Gate
				stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
				Gate token. Then draw one random Monster token from
				the Monster cup and place it on the same space.</li>
			<li>Place the Active Expedition token on the space that
				corresponds to the illustration on the back of the top card
				of the Expedition Encounter deck. If the top
card of the Expedition Encounter deck changes for any reason, move the token to the
appropriate space.</li>
			<li>Spawn the number of Clues indicated on the Reference card.
				To spawn a Clue, take one random Clue token from the
				Clue pool and place it facedown on the space indicated on
				the face of the Clue token.</li>
			<li>Finally, draw one Mystery card and place it near the Ancient
				One sheet. Then resolve any “When this card enters play”
				effects on that card.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="hidden-information">Hidden Information</h2>
		<p>Some information is intentionally hidden from players. The following
cannot be examined by players unless they are instructed by some
effect:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The back of <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided cards</a>, such as Spells or Conditions.</li>
			<li>The order and specific cards found in any deck.</li>
			<li>The front of Clues or Gates that are in the Clue pool or Gate stack.</li>
			<li>Mythos cards that have been returned to the game box.</li>
		</ul>

<p>Information that is not hidden includes the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The back of Monster tokens.</li>
	<li>The cards in discard piles.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Investigator sheets.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Ancient One sheets.</li>
	<li>The information on the back of Clue tokens that are in the discard pile or held by an investigator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although players may legally look at this information, they may find
the game more exciting if they do not look at this information unless
instructed by some effect. </p>

		<h2 id="set-aside">Set Aside</h2>

		<p>During setup, some components might be set aside. Keep these
		components near the Ancient One sheet.</p>
		<ul>
<li>Cards that have been set aside are separated by card back, shuffled,
	and placed face down next to the Ancient One sheet.</li>
<li>When a component that was set aside during setup is discarded, it
is not returned to the deck or pool like other components of that
type. Instead, it is set aside again.</li>
<li>Components that are set aside cannot be used except by effects
that specifically name them. For example, a Monster token that
has been set aside cannot be spawned except by an effect that
specifically names that token.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="object-of-the-game">Object of the Game</h2>
		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is a cooperative game. All players are on the
		same team and <a href="#winning-the-game">win or lose</a> the game together. The investigators’
		ultimate goal is to banish the Ancient One from this world by
		solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p>In addition, investigators need to deal with many threats and
		crises facing the world. These appear in the form of Gates
		(which spawn Monsters and can awaken the Ancient One) and
		<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards (which harm investigators and can end
		the game prematurely).</p>

		<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
		<p><em>Eldritch Horror</em> is played over a series of game rounds. Each
		round consists of three phases that are resolved in the following
		order:</p>
		<ol id="lead-investigator">
			<li><a href="#phase-action-phase"><strong>Action Phase:</strong></a> Investigators perform actions to move about
				the game board and prepare for the tasks ahead.</li>
			<li><a href="#phase-encounter-phase"><strong>Encounter Phase:</strong></a> Investigators fight Monsters or resolve
				encounter cards on their current space.</li>
			<li><a href="#phase-mythos-phase"><strong>Mythos Phase:</strong></a> The Lead Investigator resolves one Mythos
				card. These cards often advance the Doom token, spawn
				Gates, or raise other challenges that investigators will need
				to overcome.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The player who has the Lead Investigator token is referred to as the
“Lead Investigator” by cards and effects. At the end of each Mythos Phase, the Lead Investigator may
		pass the Lead Investigator token to any player of his choice.
		Investigators then start a new game round beginning with the
		Action Phase. Players continue resolving game rounds until
		they have won or lost the game.</p>

		<p><span class="def">Active investigator</span> refers to the investigator currently performing
actions or resolving an encounter. During the Mythos Phase, the
Lead Investigator is the active investigator.</p>

		<p>If multiple effects would be resolved at the same time during the game, the active
		investigator decides the order in which they are resolved.</p>
		<p>When investigators make a decision as a group, the Lead
		Investigator makes the final decision.</p>

		<h2 id="phase-action-phase">Phase 1: Action Phase</h2>
		<p>Performing actions is the main way in which investigators move
		about the game board and acquire beneficial cards and tokens
		(such as Asset cards and travel tickets).</p>
		<p>During the Action Phase, each investigator may perform up to two
		actions. The <a href="#lead-investigator">Lead Investigator</a> performs his two actions first, then
proceeding clockwise around the play area, each other investigator
performs his two actions.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Important:</strong> Each investigator can perform each action <strong>only
			once</strong> during a round. For example, an investigator cannot
		perform two Rest actions.</li>
		<li>If an investigator cannot or does not wish to perform an action, he
			may choose not to perform his action or actions.</li>
<li>An investigator must fully resolve an action before performing
another action. For example, he cannot interrupt a Travel action
with a Trade action, and then continue moving.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During the Action Phase, investigators may perform the
		following actions. The detailed rules for these actions are
		explained in the following sections.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#travel-action">Travel</a></li>

		<h3 id="travel-action">Travel Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator moves to any space adjacent to his current
		space. Then he may spend any number of <a href="#prepare-for-travel-action">travel tickets</a>, moving one
additional space along a Train path or Ship path for each Train Ticket
token or Ship Ticket token spent, respectively.
		The <a href="#action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</a>
		includes an example of a Travel action.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-spaces-and-paths">What are Spaces and Paths?</h3>
			<p>The different types of spaces and paths are shown on the
			“Legend” on the game board.</p>
			<p>Tokens are often placed on spaces of the game board.
			Spaces include named locations (such as “Arkham”), as
			well as numbered locations.</p>

			<p>Each space is connected to at least one other space by
			lines known as <span class="def">paths</span>. Two spaces are adjacent if they are connected by a single unbroken path.</p>
			<p>Train and Ship paths each correspond to a type of travel ticket.</p>

			<h3 id="local-paths">Local Paths</h3>

			<p class="mom">When playing with a side board, Local paths connect some spaces with dashed green lines. Spaces connected by Local paths
are so close to each other that moving between them does not
require an action.</p>
			<p>During the Action Phase, an investigator may move along any
			number of interconnected Local paths.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Each investigator may perform this movement only
				once per round.</li>
<li>This movement does not require an action but cannot
be performed by a Delayed investigator.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<h3 id="rest-action">Rest Action</h3>
		<p>The investigator recovers 1 <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health</a> and 1 <a href="#health-and-sanity">Sanity</a>. <span class="mon">Then he may spend any number of
		<a href="#gather-resources-action">Resources</a> to recover 1 additional Health or 1 additional
		Sanity for each Resource spent.</span></p>
		<p>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> perform this action if there is a Monster
		on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="trade-action">Trade Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator can trade any number of <a href="#possessions">possessions</a> with
another investigator on his space. The two investigators may freely give
any number of possessions to the other, as long as both investigators
agree to this trade.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Condition cards, Health tokens, Sanity tokens, and Improvement
				tokens cannot be traded.</li>
			<li>Investigators cannot trade with <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated</a> investigators.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="prepare-for-travel-action">Prepare for Travel Action</h3>
		<p>If the investigator is <strong>on a City space</strong>, he gains one travel ticket
		of his choice. The investigator cannot gain a Train Ticket unless
		there is at least one Train path connected to his space. Likewise,
		he cannot gain a Ship Ticket unless there is at least one Ship
		path connected to his space.</p>
		<p>An investigator cannot have more than two travel tickets. If he
already has two travel tickets when he would gain a new one, he may
discard one travel ticket before gaining the new travel ticket.</p>

		<h3 id="acquire-assets-action">Acquire Assets Action</h3>

		<p>As an action, an investigator <strong>on a City space</strong> <a href="#tests">tests</a> <span class="influence"></span>. <span class="mon">Then he may spend any

</ul>

		<h4 id="bank-loan">Bank Loan</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator performs an Acquire Assets action, he may
gain a Debt Condition to immediately add 2 successes to his test
result.</li>
<li>If an investigator already has a Debt Condition, he cannot acquire
	a Bank Loan.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>After completely resolving an Acquire Assets action, replace any cards
		discarded or gained from the reserve by drawing replacement
		cards from the Asset deck.</p>

		<h3 id="focus-action">Focus Action</h3>

		<p class="mom">As an action, an investigator on any space

		<h3 id="component-actions">Component Actions</h3>
		<p>The investigator may perform an action listed on one of his
		components (such as Investigator sheets, Conditions, and <a href="#possessions">possessions</a>). These
		actions are preceded by the word “Action” in bold.</p>

		<p>Like all actions, each component action can only be performed
once per round. Although an investigator cannot perform a component action
		from a single component more than once each round, he can
		perform component actions of different components. Multiple investigators <strong>cannot</strong> perform the same
		action on one component during a single round, except for <a href="#local-action">local
			actions</a>. For example, if an investigator uses a component action
on an Asset and then trades it to another investigator, the new
owner cannot use the component action that round.</p>

		<p class="example">Example: Lily Chen uses the action ability printed on her
		Investigator sheet. Then, for her second action, she could perform
		an action printed on an Asset card she has.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>An action ability on an Investigator sheet can be performed only
				by that investigator.</li>
			<li>An action ability on a possession or Condition can be performed
				only by the investigator who has the card.</li>
			<li id="local-action">An investigator may also perform some actions using
				components held by other investigators on his space. These
				actions are preceded by the phrase “Local Action” in bold. An investigator may perform local actions on his own possessions
and Conditions. Multiple investigators may perform the same local action during the
course of a single Action Phase.</li>
			<li class="mom">A space’s “Local Action” ability can be performed only by
investigators on that space. Each investigator may perform the
“Local Action” ability of each space only once per round.</li>

			<h3 id="action-phase-example">Action Phase Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on San Francisco at the start of the Action
					Phase. Since he has the Lead Investigator token, Silas
					resolves his two actions first.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s first action, he performs a Travel action. He
					moves from San Francisco to space 5.</li>
				<li>During his Travel action, he decides to spend his Train
					Ticket to move one additional space along the Train
					path to Arkham.</li>
				<li>For Silas’s second action, he decides to perform a Rest
					action to recover 1 Health and 1 Sanity. Since he already
					has Sanity tokens equal to his maximum Sanity, he only
					recovers the 1 Health. He takes 1 Health from the token
					pool and places it by his Investigator sheet.</li>
			</ol>
<p>Silas has performed his two actions. The investigator to
					his left may now perform two actions.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="phase-encounter-phase">Phase 2: Encounter Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, each investigator must resolve <strong>one encounter</strong>.
		Encounters often involve reading a short narrative on an
		encounter card which can have positive and/or negative effects. We recommend a player other
than the active investigator reads encounter cards and does not reveal
the results of passing or failing a test that has not yet been resolved.</p>
		<p>The investigators resolve encounters in turn order starting
with the Lead Investigator and proceeding clockwise around the play
area.</p>
		<p>During the Encounter Phase, if an investigator is on a space
		containing one or more Monsters, he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single
		Combat Encounter against each Monster on that space, one at a
		time, in the order of his choice. If there are zero Monsters on an
		investigator’s space, he instead resolves a location encounter or a
		token encounter of his choice as described in the sections below. If an investigator has the option of multiple encounters, he chooses
one.</p>

		<p>If an investigator has a Detained Condition card, he resolves the
back of his Condition card instead of resolving an encounter. He
does this <strong>even if</strong> there is a Monster on his space.</p>

		<h3 id="combat-encounters">Combat Encounters</h3>

		<p>If an investigator is on a space containing one or more Monsters,
		he <strong>must</strong> resolve a single <a href="#combat-encounter">Combat Encounter</a> against each
		Monster on that space.</p>
		<p>After an investigator resolves all Combat Encounters, if there are
		no Monsters in his space, <strong>he may resolve another encounter</strong>.</p>

		<h3 id="location-encounters">Location Encounters</h3>
		<p>The investigator draws an encounter card matching his space’s
		artwork or from the General Encounter deck. He resolves the
		effect that matches his current space, then discards the card. When an encounter deck is empty, immediately shuffle its discard pile
to form a new deck.</p>
		<p>If an investigator has multiple types of encounter cards that he
		could draw, he chooses which deck to draw from.</p>
		<p class="example">Example: An investigator is on Arkham. He can choose to draw
		a card from either the General Encounter deck or the America
		Encounter deck. If he chooses to draw a General Encounter card,
		he then resolves the “City” portion of the card.</p>
		<p>The text below some named spaces
		on the game board lists the most
		common effects found in those specific
		encounters.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator may encounter his
space by drawing a General Encounter card and resolving the
effect that corresponds to his space’s type.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Arkham, Buenos
Aires, or San Francisco may encounter that space by drawing an
America Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds
to his space’s name.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Istanbul,
London, or Rome may encounter that space by drawing a Europe
Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds to his
space’s name.</li>
<li>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Shanghai, Sydney,
or Tokyo may encounter that space by drawing an Asia/Australia
Encounter card and resolving the effect that corresponds to his
space’s name.</li>
<li class="mom">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Miskatonic
Outpost, Lake Camp, or Frozen Waste may encounter that
space by drawing an Outpost Encounter and resolving the
effect that corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="mom">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Snowy
Mountains, City of the Elder Things, or Plateau of Leng may
encounter that space by drawing a Mountain Encounter and
resolving the effect that corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="utp">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Alexandria,
The Bent Pyramid, or Cairo may encounter that space by
drawing an Egypt Encounter and resolving the effect that
corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="utp">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on The Sahara
Desert, Tel el-Amarna, or The Nile River may encounter that
space by drawing an Africa Encounter and resolving the effect
that corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="td">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on Celephaïs,
Dylath-Leen, or Ulthar may encounter that space by
drawing a Dreamlands Encounter and resolving the effect
that corresponds to his space.</li>
<li class="cir">An investigator on a <a href="#devastation-encounters">devastated
			space</a> cannot resolve a General
				Encounter or a location encounter
				that corresponds to his space.
				Instead, during the Encounter
				Phase, an investigator on a
				devastated space may encounter
				that space by drawing and
				resolving the top card of the
				Devastation Encounter deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="token-encounters">Token Encounters</h3>
		<p>Some tokens are placed on spaces of the game board and provide
		additional encounter options for investigators on that space.</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="research-encounters">Clue tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve
				Research Encounter cards.
				<ul>
					<li>When a Research Encounter says, “this Clue,” it is referring to the
						Clue being encountered.</li>
					<li>If the Clue token being encountered is not gained or discarded, it
						remains on its space and can be encountered again.</li>
					<li>When a Research Encounter says, “additional Clue,” it is referring
						to Clues in the Clue pool.</li>
					<li class="mom">When an investigator encounters a Clue on the Antarctica side
						board, he does not resolve a Research Encounter for the chosen
						Ancient One. Instead, he draws and resolves an Antarctica
						Research Encounter.
						An Antarctica Research Encounter is considered a Research
						Encounter for all game effects.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li id="other-world-encounters">Gate tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve Other
					World Encounter cards.
					<ul>
						<li>When an Other World Encounter says, “this Gate,” it is referring
							to the Gate being encountered.</li>
						<li>If an Other World Encounter card instructs an investigator to
							“close this Gate,” he discards the Gate token from his space.</li>
						<li>While an investigator is resolving an Other World Encounter, he is
							still considered to be on his current space and is not removed from
							the game board.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>The Active Expedition token allows investigators to draw
						and resolve <a href="#expedition-deck">Expedition Encounter</a> cards.
						<ul>
							<li>After resolving an Expedition Encounter, the investigator
								moves the Active Expedition token to the space that matches
								the newly-revealed top card of the Expedition Encounter deck.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li class="sr">During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on a space
						containing the Mystic Ruins token may encounter it by
						drawing and resolving the top card of the Mystic Ruins
						Encounter deck.
						<ul>
							<li>The Mystic Ruins token is placed
on the space corresponding to
the top card of the Mystic Ruins
Encounter deck. This space is
referred to as the “Mystic Ruins

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li class="td" id="dream-quest">
						During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on the space

		</ul>

		<h2 id="phase-mythos-phase">Phase 3: Mythos Phase</h2>
		<p>During this phase, the Lead Investigator draws the top card of
		the Mythos deck. If the Mythos deck is empty, the discard pile is not shuffled into
the deck. Instead, if a Mythos card cannot be drawn, the Mythos
Phase ends. Then, if investigators have not won the
game, investigators lose the game.</p>

		<p>There are seven possible effects on a Mythos
		card, and the Lead Investigator resolves them <strong>in the order they
			appear</strong> (left to right, starting from the top). The order and
		effects of each element are listed below:</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="advance-omen">Advance Omen</h3>
			<p>Move the Omen token one space clockwise
			around <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">the track</a>. Then <a href="#what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks"><strong>advance Doom</strong></a> by
			one for each Gate on the game board that
			matches the Omen token’s current space.</p>

			<h3 id="resolve-reckoning-effects">Resolve Reckoning Effects</h3>
			<p>Resolve all effects proceeded by a <span class="reckoning"></span> icon
			on components in play. These components
			are marked with a red reckoning icon in the
			lower-right corner as a visual reminder.</p>
			<p>Resolve these effects in the following order:
			Monsters, Ancient One sheet, <span class="trait">Ongoing</span>
			Mythos cards, and lastly starting with the Lead Investigator
and proceeding clockwise, each investigator resolves the <span class="reckoning"></span> effect
on each possession and Condition he has, if any, in the order of his
choice.</p>
			<p>If a Mythos card has the icon on the lower-right corner, it is a
reminder that the card has a <span class="reckoning"></span> effect. That card does not cause
other <span class="reckoning"></span> effects to be resolved.</p>
			<p>If a Monster is spawned or an investigator gains a component
while investigators are resolving <span class="reckoning"></span> effects, they do not resolve the
<span class="reckoning"></span> effect on that Monster or component.</p>

			<h3 id="spawn-gates">Spawn Gates</h3>
			<p><a href="#spawning-gates">Spawn a number of Gates</a> as defined by the
			Reference card.</p>

			<h3 id="monster-surge">Monster Surge</h3>
			<p>At <strong>each gate</strong> that matches the Omen
			token’s current space, <a href="#spawning-monsters">spawn the number of
				Monsters</a> listed on the Reference card.
			If there are no matching Gates currently on
			the game board, spawn one Gate instead.</p>

			<h3 id="spawn-clues">Spawn Clues</h3>
			<p><a href="#spawning-clues">Spawn a number of Clues</a> as defined by the
			Reference card.</p>

			<h3 id="place-rumor-token">Place Rumor Token</h3>
			<p>Place a <a href="#rumors">Rumor</a> token on the space listed.</p>

			<h3 id="place-eldritch-tokens">Place Eldritch Tokens</h3>
			<p>Place the listed number of Eldritch tokens
			on this Mythos card.</p>

			<h3 id="resolve-effect">Resolve Effect</h3>
			<p>If the card has the <span class="trait">Event</span> trait listed above
			the text effect, immediately resolve the
			effect and then discard the card. If it has
			the <span class="trait">Ongoing</span> trait, place it in play near the
			Ancient One sheet. It remains in play until
			discarded by a game effect.</p>
		</section>
		<p>Investigators <strong>resolve only the effects displayed on the current
			Mythos card</strong>. For example, if the Mythos card does not have the
		spawn clues icon, investigators do not resolve the spawn clues step.</p>

		<section id="doom">
			<h3 id="what-are-the-doom-and-omen-tracks">What are the Doom and Omen Tracks?</h3>
			<p>The <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">Ancient One awakens</a> when Doom reaches the “0” space of the <span class="def">Doom track</span>. When Doom
			<span class="def">advances</span>, move the Doom token <strong>toward</strong> the “0” space of
			the Doom track. If the Ancient One has not awoken, when Doom retreats, move the Doom
			token <strong>away from</strong> the “0” space of the Doom track.</p>
			<p>If an effect advances Doom beyond the “0” space, Doom advances
to 0, the Ancient One awakens, and then Doom continues to
advance using the Ancient One’s <a href="#awaken-doom">rules for advancing Doom</a>.</p>
			<p>The <span class="def">Omen track’s</span> purpose is to advance Doom. When the Omen advances, move the Omen token the indicated
number of spaces clockwise around the Omen track one space at a
time. For each space it enters, advance Doom by one for each Gate
on the game board that corresponds to the current Omen.</p>
			<p>The “current Omen” is the icon on the space of the Omen track
containing the Omen token.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="spawning-gates">Spawning Gates</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Gate, take the top Gate token from
		the Gate stack and place it faceup on the space indicated on the
		Gate token.</p>
		<p>When a Gate is spawned, <strong>a <a href="#spawning-monsters">Monster is spawned</a> on the same
			space</strong>.</p>
		<p>If an effect would spawn a Gate and the Gate stack and discard
		pile are empty, <strong>advance Doom by one instead</strong>.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-gates">What are Gates?</h3>
			<p>Gate tokens represent tears in the fabric of reality. These
			gateways can lead to other worlds, dimensions, or even
			points in time. These dangerous anomalies allow deadly
			powers into our world, such as Monsters and eventually
			even the Ancient Ones.</p>
			<p>Gates are the main way that Doom <a href="#advance-omen">advances</a>. To prevent
			Doom from advancing (and the Ancient One from
			awakening), investigators need to resolve <a href="#other-world-encounters">Other World
				Encounter</a> cards to close (discard) Gates.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="revealing-gates">Revealing Gates</h3>

		<p class="td">Some effects cause Gates in the Gate stack
to be revealed. Revealed Gates remain where they are in the
Gate stack unless the effect that causes the Gates to be
revealed states otherwise.</p>
<p>If an effect would cause a number of Gates to be revealed
that exceeds the number of Gates in the Gate stack, the active
investigator randomizes the Gates in the discard pile and places
them at the bottom of the Gate stack before resolving that effect.</p>
<p>After a Gate in the Gate stack has been revealed, it remains
revealed until it is removed from the Gate stack or the Gate
stack is randomized.</p>

		<h3 id="dream-portals">Dream Portals</h3>

		<p class="td">Dream Portals represent locations where the Dreamlands bleed
into the waking world. Each space containing a Dream Portal is
connected by a <a href="#local-paths">Local path</a> to the space that corresponds to that
token.</p>
<p>Some effects cause Dream Portals to spawn. To spawn a Dream
Portal, reveal Gates from the top of the Gate stack until a
Gate is revealed that corresponds to a space that is not on the
Dreamlands side board and does not contain a Dream Portal.
Place the Dream Portal on that space. A revealed Gate remains
revealed in the Gate stack; do not randomize the Gate stack
after spawning a Dream Portal.</p>
<p>If a Gate would spawn on a space containing a Dream Portal,
spawn that Gate on the space that corresponds to that Dream
Portal instead.</p>

		<h3 id="spawning-monsters">Spawning Monsters</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Monster, draw one random Monster
		token from the <a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster cup</a> and place it on the space indicated
		by the effect.</p>
		<p>If the Monster has the spawn icon, look at the
		back of the Monster token and resolve its effect
		immediately after spawning it (for example,
		“When this Monster is spawned, move it to
		Heart of Africa”).</p>
		<p>Monsters cannot be spawned from the Monster cup if the Monster
cup is empty. Set aside Monsters cannot be spawned if all set aside
Monsters of the named type are on the game board.</p>

		<h4 id="cultists">Cultists</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Unlike most Monsters, a Cultist Monster does not have
				information printed on the back of its Monster token.</li>
<li>When an investigator encounters a Cultist Monster, he references
the Cultist information on the Ancient One sheet. This includes
its <span class="will"></span> test, <span class="strength"></span> test, horror, damage, toughness, and effects.</li>
<li>All Cultist Monsters have and icons printed on their fronts.
These icons remind players to check the Ancient One sheet, which
may list a “When this Monster is spawned,” or <span class="reckoning"></span> effect.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="what-is-the-monster-cup">What is the Monster Cup?</h3>
		<p>During setup, players choose any opaque container,
		such as the game box lid, to serve as the Monster
		cup. When a Monster is spawned, one player draws a
		random Monster token from the Monster cup without
		looking. When a Monster is defeated or discarded,
		return it to the Monster cup. Then shake the container
		to randomize the Monster tokens.</p>

		<h3 id="spawning-clues">Spawning Clues</h3>
		<p>When an effect spawns a Clue, take one random Clue token
		from the Clue pool and place it facedown on the space
		indicated on the Clue token.</p>
		<p>Clues cannot be spawned or gained from the Clue pool if the Clue
		pool and discard pile are empty.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-clues">What are Clues?</h3>
			<p>Clue tokens represent secrets and lore about the Ancient
			One. Investigators can collect these tokens by resolving
			<a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounters</a>.</p>
			<p>Investigators use Clues to solve <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>, solve <a href="#rumors">Rumors</a>, and to reroll dice
			during <a href="#tests">tests</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="winning-the-game">Winning the Game</h2>
		<p>The game immediately ends when an effect specifies that
		“Investigators win the game,” or “Investigators lose the game.” In the
		rare circumstance that both of these effects happen at the same time,
		investigators win the game.</p>
		<p>Investigators win the game by solving <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a> as indicated on the front
		of the Ancient One sheet.</p>
		<p>Investigators <strong>lose the game</strong> if any of the following occur:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">Ancient One awakens</a>, the back of the Ancient
				One sheet lists how investigators can lose the game.</li>
			<li>All investigators have been <a href="#eliminated-players"><strong>eliminated</strong></a> from the game.</li>
			<li>A card effect causes investigators to lose the game. This
				most frequently appears on some <a href="#rumors"><span class="trait">Rumor</span></a> Mythos cards.</li>
			<li>The investigators are required to draw a Mythos card but
				cannot because the <strong>Mythos deck is empty</strong>.</li>
			<li class="cir">When all nine named City spaces on the main board are <a href="#devastation-encounters">devastated</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
		<p>Many effects require investigators to resolve a test, which involves
		rolling dice to determine whether he passes or fails the test. Passing
		tests often provides benefits to the investigator, while failing tests
		often have negative side effects. When an investigator resolves a test,
		he performs the following steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Determine Dice Pool:</strong> The investigator determines the number of
				dice he will roll. This number is his <span class="def">dice pool</span>.
			<ul>
				<li>He starts with a number equal to the <a href="#what-are-skills">skill</a> being tested.</li>
				<li>He adds or subtracts the test modifier (the number that follows
					the skill icon on the effect).</li>
				<li>If he has an Improvement token for the skill being tested, he
					adds the Improvement token’s modifier.</li>
				<li>He adds the <strong>single highest bonus</strong> that applies (for example “Gain
					+3 <span class="will"></span>”).</li>
				<li>He adds any “additional dice” he gains from effects that apply.
					Additional dice are cumulative and are in addition to other
					effects.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> He rolls a number of dice equal to his dice pool.
				<ul>
					<li>If an investigator’s dice pool is below 1, he rolls 1 die instead.</li>
					<li>If an investigator’s dice pool is greater than the number of dice
						available, he rolls as many dice as possible, counts his successes,
						and rolls the dice again until he has rolled a number of dice
						equal to his dice pool.</li>
					<li>Immediately after rolling, some game effects may allow the investigator to <a href="#rerolling-dice">reroll</a> some dice.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><strong>Determine Result:</strong> Each “5” or “6” rolled is one <span class="def">success</span>. The
					total number of successes rolled is the <span class="def">test result</span>. If he rolls
					at least one success, he passes the test. If he does not roll any
					successes, he <span class="def">fails</span> the test.</li>
				<li><strong>Resolve Pass or Fail Effect:</strong> The consequence of passing or failing
					the test is determined by the effect that triggered the test.</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Some effects specify only a pass effect or a fail effect. If an
				investigator passes a test that does not have a pass effect, there is no
				effect. Likewise, if an investigator fails a test that does not have a
				fail effect, he suffers no ill effects.</li>
			<li>On encounter cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
				embedded in the text in parentheses. The test declaration may also
				indicate a test modifier.</li>
			<li>Effects that are dependent on a test are always preceded by “if you
				pass,” or “if you fail.” Any effect in that sentence occurs only if you
				pass the test or fail the test, respectively. Any effect after the period
				or part of a new paragraph, is independent from previous effects.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="example">Example: Lily Chen has an “Arcane Tome” Asset card which reads:
		“When you perform a Rest action, you may test <span class="lore"></span>. If you pass,
		gain 1 Spell.” When resting, Lily resolves this test using her Lore
		(<span class="lore"></span>) of 2. She rolls 2 dice with results of “1” and “3.” Since she
		did not roll a “5” or “6,” she fails the test does not gain a Spell.</p>

		<h3 id="tests-on-cards">Tests on Cards</h3>
		<p>On many cards, tests are declared using their skill icon
		embedded in parenthesis following a short narrative. When an
		investigator is resolving an effect that includes a skill icon in the
		text, he must immediately test that skill. The test declaration
		may also indicate a modifier (such as “–1”), which causes the
		investigator to roll more or fewer dice in the test.</p>
		<p>Note that most gameplay terms are capitalized on cards to help
		differentiate them from narrative text.</p>

		<h3 id="rerolling-dice">Rerolling Dice</h3>
		<p>Immediately after rolling dice during a test, an investigator
		may spend a Clue token or a <span class="mom">Focus token</span> to reroll one die.</p>
		<p>If multiple effects allow an investigator to reroll a die, he may
resolve each effect separately. There is no limit to the number of
times a die or test can be rerolled, so long as the investigator has
the means to do so. There is no limit to the number of Clues or <span class="mom">Focus</span> he can spend
to reroll dice.</p>
		<p>When a die is rerolled, use the result of the reroll, even if the new
		result is worse. He determines whether he passed or failed after resolving all rerolls.</p>

		<p>Most reroll effects (including spending Clue tokens) specifically
		reroll dice <strong>during a test</strong>. Such effects cannot be used on other die
rolls, such as the <span class="reckoning"></span> effect of a Blessed Condition card.</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="what-are-skills">What are Skills?</h3>
			<p>Each investigator has five different skills listed on the
			bottom of his Investigator sheet. The number below
			each skill is the base number of dice the investigator rolls
			when resolving a <a href="#tests">test</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lore (<span class="lore"></span>) is often tested when casting <a href="#spells">Spells</a> and resolving
					Other World Encounters.</li>
				<li>Influence (<span class="influence"></span>) is often tested when performing the Acquire
					Assets action and resolving General Encounters on City spaces
					and Defeated Investigator Encounters.</li>
				<li>Observation (<span class="observation"></span>) is often tested when resolving Research
					Encounters and Expedition Encounters.</li>
				<li>Strength (<span class="strength"></span>) is often tested when resolving Combat
					Encounters and Expedition Encounters.</li>
				<li>Will (<span class="will"></span>) is often tested when resolving Combat Encounters and
					Other World Encounters.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<h3 id="improvement-tokens">Improvement Tokens</h3>
		<p>These tokens represent an investigator’s training
		in particular skills. When an effect allows an
		investigator to improve a skill, he gains an
		Improvement token with the matching icon and
		places it below his Investigator sheet with the “+1” side up.
		If he improves that skill a second time, he flips that token to
		the “+2” side. An investigator cannot improve a single skill more than twice. An investigator’s skill is equal to the value printed
		on his sheet plus the value of the matching Improvement token.</p>

		<h3 id="impairment-tokens">Impairment Tokens</h3>
		<p class="utp">Impairment tokens represent a permanent impairment
		to an investigator’s skills.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator impairs a skill, he gains an
				Impairment token for that skill with the “–1” side up.
			<ul>
				<li>If an investigator already has an Impairment token for
					that skill, he flips that token to the “–2” side instead.
					Each “–2” Impairment token counts as two “–1”
					Impairment tokens.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Improvement tokens and Impairment tokens negate one
				another. If an investigator has both an Improvement token
				and an Impairment token for the same skill, he discards
				both tokens.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot impair a skill if doing so reduces that
				skill’s modified value to below 1.
				<ul>
					<li>An investigator cannot choose to impair a skill if doing so
						would reduce that skill’s modified value to below 1.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>An investigator cannot impair a single skill more than twice.
					<ul>
						<li>An investigator cannot choose to impair a skill if that skill
							has already been impaired twice.</li>
					</ul></li>

an investigator’s skills as a value. A skill’s value is equal to
its printed value as modified by Improvement tokens and
Impairment tokens.</p>
		<ul><li>A skill’s value is not affected by bonuses from possessions
or other effects, since those effects are applied only when
resolving a test.</li></ul>
		<p class="example">For example, Rex Murphy has a printed <span class="influence"></span> of 3 and a single
“+1 <span class="influence"></span>” Improvement token. As such, his <span class="influence"></span> value is 4
(3 from its printed value plus 1 from his Improvement token).
The bonus to <span class="influence"></span> that Rex would gain from the Personal

		<h3 id="complex-encounters">Complex Encounters</h3>
		<p>Expedition Encounters, Other World Encounters, <span class="sr">Mystic Ruins Encounters</span>, <span class="td">Dream-Quest Encounters</span>, <a class="cir" href="#devastation-encounters">Devastation Encounters</a>, and Special
		Encounters are rewarding but dangerous experiences called
		complex encounters. Each of these cards has three effects. To
		resolve these encounters, an investigator first resolves the <span class="def">initial
			effect</span> (the top box of the card). Depending upon the result of
		this effect, he immediately resolves <strong>one</strong> of the other two effects.</p>
		<p>If he passes the <a href="#tests">test</a> in the initial effect, he resolves the card’s
		<span class="def">pass effect</span> in the middle of the card. If he fails the test, he resolves the card’s <span class="def">fail effect</span> at the bottom of the card.
		He resolves the entire effect in the appropriate box (which may
		involve additional tests), then discards the card.</p>

		<section class="example">
			<h3 id="other-world-encounter-example">Other World Encounter Example</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Silas Marsh is on a space containing a Gate token
					during the Encounter Phase.</li>
				<li>He decides to encounter the Gate, and draws a card
					from the Other World Encounter deck. He resolves
					the initial effect, and comes upon “(<span class="observation"></span>–1).” This
					means that he needs to test his Observation.</li>
				<li>He takes his investigator’s skill in Observation (3)
					and applies the test’s modifier (–1).</li>
				<li>He does not have any abilities or possessions that
					further modify this value, so he rolls 2 dice.</li>
				<li>He did not roll a “5” or “6” and, therefore, fails
					the test. He resolves the fail effect that causes him
					to lose 3 Sanity unless he spends 1 Clue. He then
					discards the Other World Encounter card.</li>

		<h2 id="gaining-possessions-and-conditions">Gaining Possessions and Conditions</h2>
		<p>Investigators frequently gain Assets, Artifacts, <a href="#spells">Spells</a>, and
		Conditions. When an investigator gains a card or token, he
		places it faceup near his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>An investigator can gain a card or token only if it is available.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A card is available if it is in the deck, discard pile, or reserve.</li>
			<li>Cards and tokens on a <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated investigator’s</a> sheet are not
available.</li>

			<li><strong>Gaining a Random Card:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator
				to gain a card (for example, “Gain 1 Artifact”). The investigator
				draws one card from the top of the deck matching the specified
				card type.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#double-sided-cards">Double-sided cards</a> are gained from the bottom of the deck.</li>
				<li>If an investigator gains a <a href="#spells">Spell</a> or Condition that he already has,
					he discards it and draws a replacement, repeating this process
					until he draws a card he does not already have (if able).</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Card with a Specific Trait:</strong> Some effects instruct an
				investigator to gain a card with a specific trait (for example, “Gain
				a <span class="trait">Madness</span> Condition”). The investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> that card type’s
				deck then discard pile for the first card matching the specified trait
				and gains that card. Then he shuffles the deck.
			<ul>
				<li>An investigator that gains a <a href="#spells">Spell</a> or Condition in this way
					searches the deck for the first card matching the specified trait
					he does not already have and gains that card.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Specific Card:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator to
				gain a specific card by name (for example, “Gain an Axe Asset”).
				The investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> that card type’s deck then discard pile
				for the first card matching the specified name and gains that card.
				Then he shuffles the deck.
			<ul>
				<li>If the named card is in the reserve, the investigator gains that
					card instead.</li>
				<li>If the specified card cannot is not found while searching, he does
					not gain a card. For instance, if other investigators or defeated
					investigators possess all copies of the card or all copies of the
					card have been returned to the game box.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Card from the Reserve:</strong> Some effects instruct an
				investigator to gain a card (sometimes with a specific trait) from
				the reserve (for example “Gain 1 <span class="trait">Ally</span> Asset from the reserve”).
				The investigator gains one card <strong>of his choice</strong> that matches the
				specified trait from the reserve.</li>
			<li><strong>Gaining a Clue:</strong> Some effects instruct an investigator to gain a
				Clue. The investigator takes one random Clue token from the
				<a href="#clue-pool">Clue pool</a>, and places it near his Investigator sheet. When a
				<a href="#research-encounters">Research Encounter</a> card instructs the investigator to “gain this
				clue,” he gains the Clue token from his space.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="search">Search</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator searches for a card, he looks at cards from
the bottom of the deck until he finds a card that matches his
search criteria.</li>
<li>If an investigator does not find a card that matches his search
criteria while searching a deck, he then searches that deck’s
discard pile.</li>
<li>After a deck is searched, the investigator shuffles that deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="possessions">Possessions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>An investigator’s possessions include his Clue tokens, travel ticket
				tokens, <a href="#gather-resources-action">Resource</a> tokens, Asset cards, Artifact cards, <a href="#spells">Spell</a> cards, and <span class="#mom">Unique Asset</span> cards.</li>
			<li>If an effect does not list a limit, it may be used only once per
instance of the triggered event. For example, if an Asset allows an
investigator to recover 1 additional Health when he performs a
Rest action, he may only use that effect once per Rest action.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="double-sided-cards">Double-Sided Cards</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Double-sided cards of the same type do not share a common back and instead have hidden
		information on the back of their cards.
				They can be identified by the card type under the card’s name.</li>
			<li>When a player gains a double-sided card, he can <strong>only
					look at the front</strong> of the card. The card describes
				when an investigator flips it, at which point
		he immediately resolves the back of the card. When a card is flipped to its front side, do not resolve the
effects on its front.</li>
<li>Decks of double-sided cards remain faceup. Investigators may look
	at the front of the top card of each deck of double-sided cards.</li>
<li>When an investigator draws a random card from a deck of double-
	sided cards, he draws the bottom card.</li>
<li>When a double-sided card is discarded, it is immediately shuffled
	back into its respective deck.</li>
<li>After a player shuffles a deck of double-sided cards, another player
	cuts the deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="spells">Spells</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Spell cards are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided</a>. An investigator <strong>cannot look at the
					back of Spell cards</strong> unless an effect allows him to.</li>
			<li>An investigator can resolve a Spell card’s effect as described on the
				card. A Spell card’s effect may be triggered by a specific event or
				require an action.</li>
			<li>When an investigator resolves a Spell card’s effect, he resolves the
				effects on the front of the card. This may include a test and/or
				flipping the card.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot have multiple copies of the same Spell card.
				If he gains a duplicate Spell card for any reason, he discards the
				newly-gained card.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Condition cards are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided</a>. An investigator <strong>cannot look at
					the back of Conditions</strong> unless an effect allows him to.</li>
<li>Conditions cannot be traded.</li>
<li>An investigator <strong>cannot</strong> have multiple copies of the same
Condition. An investigator cannot choose to gain a copy of a Condition
that he already has. If he would gain a Condition that he already has a
copy of, he does not gain another copy of that Condition.</li>
<li>Some Conditions allow an investigator to perform unique actions
	as described on the card.</li>
<li>If a Condition’s effect does not list a limit, it may only be used
	once per instance of the triggered event.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="lost-in-time-and-space">Lost in Time and Space</h4>
		The Lost in Time and Space Condition affects investigators differently than other
		Conditions. When an investigator gains a Lost in Time and
		Space Condition, he resolves the following effects:
		<ul>
			<li>He removes his Investigator token from the game board.</li>
			<li>He passes the Lead Investigator token to another
				investigator, if able.</li>
			<li>He discards any Detained Condition he has.</li>
		</ul>
		While an investigator has a Lost in Time and Space Condition,
		he follows the rules below:
		<ul>
			<li>He cannot move or perform actions.</li>
			<li>He does not occupy any space on the game board, nor does
				he occupy the same space as tokens or other investigators.
				This includes other investigators that have Lost in Time
				and Space Conditions.</li>
			<li>He is unaffected by effects of Mythos cards, <span class="reckoning"></span> effects, or
				any other game effects except those of his Lost in Time and
				Space Condition.</li>
			<li>His Investigator’s passive ability cannot be resolved and
				does not affect other elements of the game.</li>
			<li>He cannot spend resources as a part of a group.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot give the Lead Investigator token
				to another investigator that has a Lost in Time and
				Space Condition.</li>
			<li>If a Lost in Time and Space Condition effect would “spawn
				1 Gate” and there are no Gates in the Gate stack or discard
				pile, he (the investigator) chooses one Gate on the game board instead.</li>
			<li>An investigator that has a Lost in Time and Space
				Condition loses the game if investigators lose the game, and
				he wins the game if investigators win the game.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="unique-assets">Unique Assets</h3>

		<p>Unique Assets are <a href="#double-sided-cards">double-sided cards</a>. An investigator cannot look at
		the back of Unique Assets unless an effect allows him to. There is no limit to the number of Unique
		Assets an investigator can have.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>“Asset” refers to both Assets and Unique Assets. “Non-Unique
				Asset” refers to Assets but not Unique Assets.</li>
			<li>When a Unique Asset is discarded, also discard all
				tokens on it.</li>
			<li>After resolving the effects on the back of a Unique Asset,
if the investigator was not instructed to “flip this card”, the
Unique Asset is shuffled into the Unique Asset deck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="discarding">Discarding</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>An investigator can discard only his own possessions and
				Condition cards.</li>
			<li>When an effect discards a token from the game board, the active
				investigator discards that token.</li>
			<li>Whenever a card is discarded, it is placed in a faceup discard pile
				by its deck.</li>
			<li><a href="#double-sided-cards">Double-sided cards</a>, such as <a href="#spells">Spells</a> or <a href="#conditions">Conditions</a>, are immediately
				shuffled back into their respective decks when discarded.</li>
			<li>When an investigator <a href="#search">searches</a> a deck for a specific card and does not
				find the card he is looking for, he also searches that deck’s discard pile.</li>
			<li>When a deck of cards is empty, immediately shuffle its discard pile
				to form a new deck and have another player cut the deck. The Mythos deck is never replenished.</li>
			<li>When Clue tokens are discarded, they are placed in a faceup discard
				pile near the <a href="#clue-pool">Clue pool</a>. If there are no Clue tokens remaining in the
				Clue pool, place the Clue tokens from the discard pile facedown in
				the Clue pool and randomize them.</li>
			<li>When Gate tokens are discarded, they are placed in a faceup
				discard pile near the <a href="#gate-stack">Gate stack</a>. If there are no Gate tokens
				remaining in the Gate stack, place the Gate tokens from the
				discard pile facedown in the Gate stack and randomize them.</li>
			<li>When Monster tokens are discarded, they are returned to the
				<a href="#what-is-the-monster-cup">Monster cup</a>, and the cup is randomized.</li>
			<li>Monsters that have been <a href="#set-aside">set aside</a> during setup are never returned
				to the Monster cup. Instead, they are set aside when discarded.</li>
			<li>All other tokens are returned to the token pool when discarded.</li>
			<li>If an effect forces an investigator to discard a component and he
				does not have enough of that component, he discards all of that
				component instead.</li>
			<li>Components that are not on the game board cannot be discarded
				from the game board. If an effect forces investigators to discard a
				component from the game board and there is not enough of that
				component on the board, they discard all of that
				component instead.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="spend">Spend</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When an investigator spends a token or card, such as a Clue token,
				he discards it in exchange for an effect.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot spend a token or card he does not have.</li>
			<li>An investigator may choose not to spend a token or card he has.</li>
			<li>An investigator cannot spend Health or Sanity if doing so would
				cause him to be <a href="#defeated-investigators">defeated</a> (i.e., he cannot spend his last Health
				or Sanity).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="delayed-investigators">Delayed Investigators</h2>
		<p>Investigators can become Delayed by various effects. A Delayed
		investigator cannot perform any actions.</p>
		<p>If an investigator would become Delayed on his turn during the Action
Phase, he immediately ends his action and loses all remaining
actions <strong>instead of becoming Delayed</strong>.</p>
		<p>When an investigator becomes Delayed, he tips his Investigator
		token on its side to remember that he is Delayed. Instead of
		performing actions during the Action Phase, he stands up his
		Investigator token and is no longer Delayed.</p>

		<h2 id="health-and-sanity">Health and Sanity</h2>
		<p>Each investigator starts the game with Health and Sanity
		tokens equal to his maximum Health and Sanity, respectively.</p>
		<p>When an effect causes an investigator to lose Health or Sanity,
		he discards Health or Sanity tokens from his Investigator sheet.</p>
		<p>If an investigator <span class="def">recovers</span> Health or Sanity, he gains Health
		and Sanity tokens from the token pool. An investigator cannot
		have more Health or Sanity than his maximum.</p>
		<p>Health or Sanity tokens that are marked with a “3” represent three
single Health or Sanity tokens, respectively. Players may swap a “3”
token for three single tokens or three single tokens for a “3” token
at any time.</p>
		<p>Effects that prevent the loss of Health or Sanity cannot be used
		when an investigator <a href="#spend"><strong>spends</strong></a> Health or Sanity. An investigator cannot spend Health or Sanity if doing so would
cause him to be defeated (i.e., he cannot spend his last Health or
Sanity).</p>

		<h3 id="defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>When an investigator has zero <a href="#health-and-sanity">Health or Sanity</a>, he is
		immediately <span class="def">defeated</span>, stops resolving any encounter or action he is currently resolving, and resolves the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Advance Doom:</strong> Advance Doom by 1.
				<li><strong>Relocation:</strong> Move the Investigator token to the <a href="#nearest">nearest</a>
					City space. Then lay the Investigator token on its side and
					place a Health token on it to indicate the investigator has
					lost all Health, or place a Sanity token on it to indicate the
					investigator has lost all Sanity. If the investigator has lost all <strong>Health and Sanity</strong>, he chooses
either a Health token or a Sanity token to place on his
Investigator token.</li>
				<li><strong>Collect Possessions:</strong> The investigator discards all Condition
					cards, Health, Sanity, and Improvement tokens and places
					his <a href="#possessions">possessions</a> on his Investigator sheet. He places the sheet and
					possessions out of the way; they will be needed if an
					investigator encounters this defeated investigator.</li>
				<li><strong>Pass Lead Investigator:</strong> If the defeated investigator has
					the Lead Investigator token, he must pass the token to an
					investigator of his choice.</li>
		</ol>
			<p>A defeated investigator is not considered an investigator. A
defeated investigator cannot perform actions, resolve effects, or be
affected by effects that affect investigators.</p>
		<p>After resolving the steps above, investigators continue resolving
		the current phase of the game.</p>

		<h3 id="choosing-a-new-investigator">Choosing a New Investigator</h3>
		<p>If an investigator is defeated, the player controlling that
		investigator chooses a new investigator at the end of the Mythos
		Phase. To choose a new investigator, he <strong>chooses any unused
			Investigator and follows <a href="#choose-and-place-investigators">steps 3–4 of setup</a></strong>.
		A player may not
choose an investigator that has been previously defeated during the
same game. If the Ancient One has <a href="#the-ancient-one-awakens">awoken</a> or the player cannot choose a new investigator because
there are none available, he is <a href="#eliminated-players">eliminated</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="encountering-defeated-investigators">Encountering Defeated Investigators</h3>
		<p>Investigators may encounter a defeated investigator’s token in
		order to retrieve its possessions and possibly retreat doom.</p>
		<p>If an investigator is on the same space as a defeated
		investigator’s token during the encounter phase, he may resolve
		one of the encounters on the back of the defeated investigator’s
		sheet. He resolves the “Crippled” encounter if the Investigator
		token has a Health token on it or the “Insane” encounter if the
		Investigator token has a Sanity token on it.</p>
		<p>After resolving this encounter, remove the defeated Investigator
		token and Investigator sheet from the game. That investigator
		cannot be used for the remainder of the game.</p>

		<h3 id="devoured-investigators">Devoured Investigators</h3>
		<p>Some game effects cause investigators to be devoured. When
		an investigator is devoured, he is considered defeated but only
		follows steps <strong>1 and 4</strong> of <a href="#defeated-investigators">Defeated Investigators</a>.
		He then discards all Conditions, possessions, Health, Sanity,
		and Improvement tokens and returns his Investigator sheet
		and token to the game box. At the end of the Mythos Phase, he
		<a href="#choosing-a-new-investigator">chooses a new investigator</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="combat-encounter">Combat Encounter</h2>

		<p>Resolving Combat Encounters is the main way in which
		investigators can defeat <a href="#spawning-monsters">Monsters</a> to remove them from the
		game board.</p>

		<p>During the Encounter Phase, an investigator on a space containing
		one or more Monsters must encounter each Monster on his space, one at a
		time, in the order of his choice, <span class="fl">encountering all non-Epic Monsters
			before Epic Monsters</span>. An investigator resolves a Combat Encounter by
		following these steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Check Monster Effects:</strong> The Monster might have effects that alter how
				the investigator resolves the combat. Flip the
				Monster token facedown and read the information on the
				back of the token before resolving any other part of the Combat Encounter.</li>
			<li><strong>Resolve Will Test:</strong> The investigator resolves the Will (<span class="will"></span>) <a href="#tests">test</a> listed on the
		Monster token.
			<ul>
				<li>If the Monster’s <span class="def">horror</span> (the number next to the Sanity icon) is greater than the test result, the
					investigator loses Sanity equal to the difference.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Resolve Strength Test:</strong> The investigator resolves the Strength (<span class="strength"></span>) <a href="#tests">test</a> listed on the
		Monster token.
			<ul>
				<li>If the Monster’s <span class="def">damage</span> (the number next to the Health icon) is greater than the test result, the
					investigator loses Health equal to the difference.</li>
				<li>If he passes, the Monster loses Health equal to the test result.
					Indicate this by placing a equal number of Health tokens on
					the Monster token. The investigator and Monster lose
					Health simultaneously.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ol>

		<ul>
			<li class="fl">Some Monsters require the player to test
skills other than <span class="will"></span> and <span class="strength"></span>. If a Monster has another skill icon in place of either the <span class="will"></span>
or <span class="strength"></span> test indicators, the player tests the indicated skill in
place of the skill it replaced.</li>
			<li>When a Monster has lost Health equal to or greater than its
				toughness, the Monster is defeated and returned to the monster cup.</li>
			<li>If a Monster does not have a <span class="will"></span> or <span class="strength"></span> test, the investigator does
				not resolve that test.</li>
			<li>If an investigator defeats every Monster on his space during the
				Encounter Phase, he may resolve an additional encounter of
				his choice.</li>
		<li>If the investigator did not defeat the Monster, it remains on his
		space along with any Health tokens on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="magical-resistance">Magical Resistance</h3>

		<p class="mom">When resolving a Combat
		Encounter against a Monster with the Magical Resistance
		ability, an investigator cannot apply any bonus to his die

		<h2 id="epic-monsters">Epic Monsters</h2>
		<p>Some Monsters are so powerful or
		unmanageable that they are immune to
		some effects. Epic Monsters are treated like
		Monsters for all effects except for the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be defeated unless it has lost Health equal
		to or greater than its toughness, at which point it is returned to the game box.</li>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be discarded.</li>
			<li>An Epic Monster cannot be moved, except by an effect on its

			<li>Epic Monsters are never placed in the Monster cup and are spawned by specific effects that call them out
		by name.</li>
			<li>When an Epic Monster is defeated, it is returned to the game box.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>“Monster” refers to a Monster and/or an Epic Monsters. “Non-Epic Monster” refers to a Monster but not an Epic Monster.</p>

		<h2 id="ambush">Ambush</h2>
		<p>Some effects cause investigators to encounter Monsters that
		are not on the game board. When an effect says “A Monster
		ambushes you,” the investigator draws one random Monster
		from the Monster cup and immediately encounters it in
		<a href="#combat-encounter">combat</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The Monster is not spawned. If it has a “when spawned” effect, do

<li>After resolving the Combat Encounter, the Monster is discarded
	even if it was not defeated, and the investigator continues

		<ul>
			<li>Do not discard any other tokens
				placed by the <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card such as Clues, non-Epic
				Monsters, or Gates spawned by its effects.</li>
			<li>Do not discard
				any Conditions or tokens gained by investigators due to the
				<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card’s effects.</li>
		</ul>

			<h3 id="how-do-you-determine-a-random-space">How do you Determine a Random Space?</h3>
			<p>Some effects found on <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos cards and
			Mysteries place tokens on a “random space.” Whenever
			an effect refers to a random space, that space is
			determined by drawing one Clue token from the Clue
			pool and using the space indicated by the back of the
			token. The drawn Clue token is then discarded.</p>
			<p>If there are no Clue tokens remaining in the Clue pool or discard
			pile, the Lead Investigator chooses a space instead.</p>
		</section>

		<h2 id="disasters">Disasters</h2>
		<p>Disasters represent natural or
unnatural destructive forces that
act on the cities of the world or
other locations.</p>
<p>Some effects cause the investigators
to draw and resolve one or more
Disasters. To do so, the Lead
Investigator draws the top card of the
Disaster deck, then he reads the card
aloud to all investigators, resolving
the card’s effects as instructed.</p>
<p>The card’s effect is resolved
immediately. After resolving the card’s effect in its entirety, the
card is discarded to a faceup discard pile by the Disaster deck.</p>

		<h2 id="mysteries">Mysteries</h2>
		<p>In order to win the game, investigators need to solve a number of
		Mysteries as indicated on the Ancient One sheet. Each Ancient One has its own deck of Mystery cards
		with a unique set of tasks that the investigators must resolve.</p>
		<p>During setup, draw one Mystery card and place it faceup next
		to the Ancient One sheet. Each card lists how investigators can
		solve that Mystery.</p>

		<p>“Active Mystery” refers to the faceup Mystery card in play that has
not yet been solved. When the active Mystery is solved or removed from play, discard
all tokens on it or placed by it. Then draw a new Mystery, placing
it <strong>on top of</strong> any solved Mysteries.</p>

		<p>As soon as investigators solve the number of Mysteries indicated on the front of the Ancient One sheet, investigators win the
		game. If the Ancient One awakens, investigators additionally need to solve
		the <a href="#final-mystery">Final Mystery</a>.</p>

		<p>If a solved Mystery is shuffled into the deck or returned to the
game box, that Mystery no longer counts as a solved Mystery.</p>

		<h3 id="advancing-the-active-mystery">Advancing the Active Mystery</h3>

		<p>Some game effects “advance the active
		Mystery.” Due to the complexity of Mysteries, this can result in
		a number of different effects. When investigators are instructed
		to advance the active Mystery, the active investigator resolves
		one of the following effects that applies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the active Mystery requires one or more tokens to be placed
				on the card, place one token of that type on the card.
			<ul>
				<li>Clues, Gates, and Monsters placed on the active Mystery
					in this way are drawn from the Clue pool, Gate stack, and
					Monster cup, respectively.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>If the active Mystery requires an Epic Monster to be defeated,
				place two Health on the card. The Epic Monster’s toughness
				is reduced by one for each Health on the active Mystery.<ul>
					<li>However, if the active Mystery requires more than one
Epic Monster to be defeated, place only one Health on the
card. The toughness of each Epic Monster spawned by the
Mystery is reduced by one for each Health on the card.</li></ul></li>
			<li>If the active Mystery requires an investigator to spend one
				or more Clues, place one Clue from the Clue pool on the
				card. Any investigator may spend Clues placed on the active
				Mystery when resolving an effect of that card.</li>
			<li class="mon">If the active Mystery instructed you to set aside Adventure
cards, treat the current Adventure as the active Mystery for
purposes of advancing the active Mystery.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="the-ancient-one-awakens">The Ancient One Awakens</h2>
		<p>When the Doom token reaches the “0” space of the Doom
		track, the Ancient One <span class="def">awakens</span>. Flip the Ancient One sheet and
		immediately resolve the “Awakens” effects (if any) on the upper-
		left corner of the sheet. This sheet remains facedown for the rest
		of the game, and its effects replace those found on the front of the
		sheet (including Cultist information). The back of the Ancient
		One sheet describes how the investigators can lose the game and describes the <a href="#final-mystery">Final Mystery</a> which the investigators must complete in
	addition to the other <a href="#mysteries">Mysteries</a>.</p>
		<p id="awaken-doom">After the Ancient One awakens, Doom cannot retreat. The
Ancient One sheet describes what happens if Doom advances after
the Ancient One awakens.</p>

		<h3 id="eliminated-players">Eliminated Players</h3>
		<p>After the Ancient One has awakened, when an investigator is
		defeated or devoured, the player controlling that investigator is
		<span class="def">eliminated</span>. Eliminated players do not select a new investigator
		to control and can no longer participate in the game.</p>
		<p>If all players are eliminated, investigators lose the game.</p>
		<p>If the investigators win the game, any eliminated players win as well.</p>

		<h3 id="final-mystery">Final Mystery</h3>
		<p>Once the Ancient One awakens, it is much more difficult
		for investigators to win the game. Each Ancient One sheet
		describes one <span class="def">Final Mystery</span> the investigators must solve in
		order to win the game, usually confronting the Ancient One
		head-on.</p>

		<h2 id="return-to-the-game-box">Return to the Game Box</h2>

		<p>Components that have been returned to the game box are removed
		from the game unless specifically recalled from the game box.</p>

		<h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>

		<p>If an effect references “half” of a number, round up to determine the
		final number.</p>

		<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Artifact, Asset, Condition, Spell and Mythos cards have traits.</li>
			<li>Traits can be identified by their formatting: bold, italic, and small
				caps (for example “<span class="trait">Weapon</span>”). A card’s
traits are separated by spaces and/or commas.</li>
			<li>Traits have no inherent effects of their own.</li>
	<li>Effects may refer to cards by their trait. For example, “Gain a
		<span class="trait">Madness</span> Condition.”</li>
	</ul>

<h2 id="optional-rules">Optional Rules</h2>

<p>Some players may wish to adjust the game’s difficulty or keep score in
order to compare their success across multiple games. This section lists
optional rules for adjusting the game’s difficulty and length or keeping
score.</p>

<h3 id="adjusting-game-difficulty">Adjusting Game Difficulty</h3>

<p>Some groups may find Eldritch Horror too easy or too challenging. If
all players agree at the start of the game, they can make the game easier
or harder as listed below.</p>

<h4 id="mythos-deck">Mythos Deck</h4>
<p>Players can alter the game’s difficulty when building the Mythos deck.</p>
<p>Players can make the game easier by returning all hard Mythos cards
(with red tentacles) to the game box before building the Mythos deck.</p>
<p>Likewise, players can make the game harder by returning all easy Mythos
cards (with a blue sigil) to the game box before building the Mythos deck.</p>

<h4 id="insane-game-difficulty">Insane Game Difficulty</h4>
<p>If players wish to have an even more challenging game experience, they can make
the game significantly more difficult by building the Mythos
deck using only hard Mythos cards.</p>
<p>Note—This optional rule may require several expansions
depending on the chosen Ancient One.</p>

<h4 id="starting-rumor">Starting Rumor</h4>
<p>If players want a greater challenge, they may choose to begin the game
with one starting <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card. After setup, draw one unused
	<span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card from the game box and place it in play. Resolve
any “When this card enters play,” effects, as well as the Place Rumor
Token icon (if it appears on the card). Do not spawn Clues from the
Rumor’s Spawn Clues icon.</p>

<h4 id="staged-difficulty">Staged Difficulty</h4>
<p>Players can make the game’s difficulty increase in stages by
building stage I of the Mythos deck using only easy Mythos
cards, building stage II of the Mythos deck using only normal
Mythos cards, and building stage III of the Mythos deck using
only hard Mythos cards.</p>
<ul><li>
To increase the difficulty of this optional rule, players can
use normal blue Mythos cards when building stage I of the
Mythos deck and hard blue Mythos cards when building
stage II of the Mythos deck. Players may also start with
an easy blue Mythos card in play following the <a href="#starting-rumor">Starting
	Rumor</a> rule.</li></ul>

<h4 id="control-your-fate">Control Your Fate</h4>
<p class="mom">Instead of drawing a random Prelude card before setup,
players as a group may choose one Prelude card, following
the card’s effects as normal.</p>
<p>Alternatively, players may choose to not use a Prelude card.</p>

<h4 id="variant-reference-cards">Variant Reference Cards</h4>

<p>With the introduction of new mechanics in Eldritch Horror expansions, some player groups may wish for a more difficult or more
relaxed experience with certain player counts. Use the following values instead of those on the Reference Card in order to increase or decrease the
game’s difficulty.</p>

<table>
	<tr><th>Player Count</th>
		<th>Difficulty</th>
		<th>Gates</th>
		<th>Clues</th>
		<th>Surge</th>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Easier</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>Harder</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>Easier</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>Harder</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td>Harder</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
<p>If investigators win the game, they can determine how well they did
and record this score on a sheet of paper along with the Ancient One
and any optional rules used. The lower the score, the better!
To calculate a score, start with zero, then:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add one for each Gate on the game board.</li>
	<li>Add one for every three Monsters on the game board (rounded up).</li>
	<li>Add one for each Cursed or Dark Pact Condition investigators have.</li>
	<li>Add three for each <span class="trait">Rumor</span> Mythos card in play.</li>
	<li>Subtract one for every three Clue tokens investigators have
		(rounded up).</li>
	<li>Subtract one for each Blessed Condition investigators have.</li>
	<li>Subtract the current level of Doom.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="campaign-mode">Campaign Mode</h3>
<p>This expansion features a new mode of play to challenge experienced players. With the campaign mode, players will embark
upon a series of six sequential games. Over the course of these games, major events within each game will create lasting effects
that linger until the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>The goal is <strong>win all six games</strong> of the campaign. If the investigators lose any single game, the world has ended
and the <strong>investigators lose the campaign</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="campaign-setup">Campaign Setup</h4>
<p>Each game of a campaign is set up in the same way as a normal
game except as stated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You must use <a href="#personal-stories">personal stories</a>.</li>
	<li>The Ancient One for the first game is selected at random.
Also randomly determine a second Ancient One that will
be played against in the next game of the campaign.</li>
<li>The game is played using two Preludes: one that
corresponds to the current Ancient One and a second
for the Ancient One that will be played against next
game. Each Ancient One is listed below with its
corresponding Prelude.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ancient-one-specific-preludes">Ancient One Specific Preludes</h5>

		<span class="prelude">The Dunwich Horror</span></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="subsequent-games">Subsequent Games</h4>
<p>Subsequent games of the campaign are set up in the same
manner as the first. However, the following rules and
additional steps of setup must be followed:
<ul>
	<li>The Ancient One for each subsequent game was determined
during setup of the previous game. The Ancient One for the
next game must be determined at random during setup to
inform which two Preludes will be used in the game.
<ul>
<li>For the sixth and final game, instead of determining
a second Ancient One, play using the Prelude for the
current Ancient One and the Unto the Breach Prelude.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once an Ancient One has been defeated, that Ancient One
	cannot be selected again during the same campaign.</li>
<li>Investigators that have been defeated or devoured in a
previous game are permanently eliminated and cannot be
chosen when selecting an investigator.</li>
<li>The surviving investigators from the previous game are the
chosen investigators to begin the new game. Players who
were eliminated at the end of the previous game may select
new investigators from the remaining pool.</li>
<li>If you gained your Reward or Consequence from your
	personal story, you begin the new game with that card.</li>
<li>If you ended the previous game with a Dark Pact Condition
or a Promise of Power Condition, you begin the new game
with a copy of that Condition.</li>
<li>All cities that had been <a href="#devastation-encounters">devastated</a> during previous games
begin devastated in the new game.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other components and effects are reset between games.
Undefeated investigators do not retain the possessions or skill
improvements they accrued during previous games; defeated
investigators and their possessions are returned to their
respective decks and pools; gates and monsters do not remain
on the game board; etc.</p>

<h3 id="solo-game">Solo Game</h3>
<p>To play a single player game of Eldritch Horror, follow all of the
normal rules while using a single investigator. During setup for a single
investigator game, return all components with the <span class="trait">Teamwork</span> trait to
the game box.</p>
<p>For a slightly more dynamic game, the player can choose to control
multiple investigators instead of one. In this situation, choose multiple
investigators during setup and use the corresponding Reference card.
Treat each investigator as if it were being controlled by a different
player. For example, one investigator is the Lead Investigator and they
take separate turns during the Action Phase and Encounter Phase.</p>

or another investigator to perform the Acquire Assets action
only if he is on a City space and only if there are no Monsters
on his space.</p>

<h3 id="jim-culver">Jim Culver</h3>
	<p>Jim and other investigators on his space recover
		Sanity from his action ability in addition to any
		Sanity recovered from a Rest action performed
		during the current Action Phase.</p>

<h3 id="kate-winthrop">Kate Winthrop</h3>
<p class="td">If Kate is on a space containing a
Dream Portal and a Gate would spawn on that space,
Both the Dream Portal effect and Kate’s
passive ability will attempt to replace the Gate spawn.
The active investigator decides which effect takes priority.
As such, he could have Kate’s passive ability cause the
Gate to be discarded instead of spawning.</p>

<h3 id="leo-anderson">Leo Anderson</h3>
	<p>Leo can perform his action ability on any space, even
		if there is a Monster on his space. If he rolls at least
		one success, he chooses a single <span class="trait">Ally</span> Asset from the
		reserve or discard pile, regardless of that Asset’s value,
		and gains that card.</p>

<h3 id="lily-chen">Lily Chen</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If Lily uses her action ability she must spend only
		Health or only Sanity. She cannot spend both. She
		cannot spend Health to recover Health or spend
		Sanity to recover Sanity.</li>
	<li>Lily cannot use her passive ability to improve a skill more than
		twice. If she improves a skill and already has an Improvement
		token for that skill, she cannot use her passive ability.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lola-hayes">Lola Hayes</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>When Lola uses her action ability, each “+2”
		Improvement token she spends counts as two “+1”
		Improvement tokens. All spent tokens are discarded.</p>
		<p>She can choose to improve the same skill twice with this ability if
		she has spent an appropriate number of Improvement tokens.</p></li>
	<li>Lola can use her passive ability on herself. Like all additional dice
		effects, this must be declared before the investigator rolls the test.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="luke-robinson">Luke Robinson</h3>
<ul class="td">
	<li>
		<p>Luke can resolve his passive ability to ignore Monsters
		on his space when choosing an encounter. However, he must
		choose to encounter a Gate.</p>
		<p>The most common way to encounter a Gate is to draw and
		resolve an Other World Encounter card. However, resolving
		any encounter that requires Luke to occupy a space containing
		a Gate is encountering a Gate. For example, the Caught in the
		Web Mystery grants a different option for encountering a Gate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Luke’s Investigator token is not placed during <a href="#choose-and-place-investigators">step 3 of
			setup</a> as usual. After resolving setup, Luke chooses a space
		that contains a Gate and places his Investigator token on that
		space. If there are no Gates on the game board, he places his
		Investigator token on a space of his choice instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mandy-thompson">Mandy Thompson</h3>
<p class="utp">After resolving a Research Encounter, Mandy’s
passive ability could allow her to gain an additional Clue.
This Clue is gained from her passive ability, not from
the Research Encounter.</p>

<h3 id="marie-lambeau">Marie Lambeau</h3>
<p class="mon">If Marie has gained her Reward card (“Smokey Velvet”) and performs an action, her Reward effect
does not allow an investigator to also perform that action if
that investigator has already performed that action this round.
However, after performing her action ability (which allows her
to perform an action she has already performed this round),
her Reward effect can allow another investigator to perform
an action the investigator has already performed.</p>

<h3 id="mark-harrigan">Mark Harrigan</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If Mark’s action ability causes a Monster to lose its
		last Health, he has defeated that Monster. However,
		this does not count as a Combat Encounter.</li>
	<li><p>If an effect has a choice between two or more outcomes and Mark
		chooses to become Delayed or to gain a Detained Condition
		from that effect, he is Delayed or gains a Detained Condition,
		respectively. Mark is not affected by effects that say “become
		Delayed” or “gain a Detained Condition” without a choice.</p>
		<p>If an effect says, “Become Delayed unless,” or, “Gain a Detained
		Condition unless,” Mark is not affected by that effect, even if he
		chooses not to resolve the effect following “unless.”</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sister-mary">Sister Mary</h3>
<p>Sister Mary and each other investigator on her space adds
1 to the result of each die rolled as part of an effect printed
on a Condition card that has the <span class="trait">Bane</span> or <span class="trait">Boon</span> trait. This
modification applies whether the die is rolled as part of a
test or not.</p>

<h3 id="michael-mcglen">Michael McGlen</h3>
<ul class="soc">
<li>Michael can use his action ability even if he already has
a Wanted Condition. If he does, he resolves all effects of the
ability except that he will not gain another Wanted Condition.</li>
<li>Michael’s passive ability allows him to reroll
	any single die that is rolled as part of a <span class="trait">Deal</span> or <span class="trait">Pursuit</span>
Condition’s effect even if the die is not rolled as part of a test.
This includes the one die rolled when resolving the <span class="reckoning"></span> effect of
a Dark Pact Condition or a Promise of Power Condition.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="phan-thi-minh">Phan Thi Minh</h3>
<p class="utp">Minh’s action ability is not a <a

gain a travel ticket of
her choice, even if her space is not connected to another space by the
appropriate path and even if she is not on a City space.</p>

<h3 id="norman-withers">Norman Withers</h3>
	<p>Norman may use his passive ability anytime he
		could spend a Clue. For example, he may use this
		ability to reroll a die during a test or to pay for his
		action ability.</p>

<h3 id="preston-fairmont">Preston Fairmont</h3>
<p class="mon">The actions granted by Preston’s action ability can

skill of his choice and then gains a Cursed Condition.</p>

<h3 id="sefina-rousseau">Sefina Rousseau</h3>
<p class="mon">The two successes required for Sefina’s passive ability to
trigger must be rolled on the dice during her test. Successes granted by another effect (such as accepting a bank
loan) do not count toward the requirement. However, Sefina
may use any rerolls or other dice manipulation effects to
achieve her two successes.</p>

<h3 id="silas-marsh">Silas Marsh</h3>
	<p>Silas cannot spend travel tickets to move additional
		spaces when using his action ability. The additional
		action granted by this ability does not count against
		his usual two actions per round. He may use his
		action ability and the Travel action during the same round.</p>

<h3 id="skids-o-toole">“Skids” O’toole</h3>
<p>When resolving a test, Skids can reroll any
die with a result of 1. There is no limit to the number of dice
he can reroll or the number of times a die can be rerolled.</p>

<h3 id="trish-scarborough">Trish Scarborough</h3>
	<p>When an investigator on Trish’s space, including
		herself, would spend a Clue to reroll a die during a
		test, Trish may allow that investigator to reroll two
		dice instead. If that investigator’s dice pool is only
		one die, Trish cannot use her passive ability.</p>

<h3 id="ursula-downs">Ursula Downs</h3>
<p class="mom">Once per round, Ursula may choose to spend one fewer
Focus when paying for an effect, including spending a Focus to
reroll a die when resolving a test. This can reduce the cost of an
effect to zero Focus.</p>

<h3 id="wendy-adams">Wendy Adams</h3>
<p class="soc">If an effect allows Wendy to choose to gain a Condition as
part of a cost, such as “you may gain 1 <span class="trait">Madness</span> Condition” or
“unless you gain a Blight Condition,” she may use her passive
ability to not gain that Condition instead. If she does, the cost
of gaining the Condition has still been paid.</p>

<h3 id="wilson-richards">Wilson Richards</h3>
<p class="mom">If Wilson or another investigator on Wilson’s space
spends a Focus to reroll a die and his dice pool is only one die,
that investigator cannot use Wilson’s passive ability to reroll that single die twice.</p>

	<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

	<p>This section lists clarifications to commonly overlooked rules organized
by topic.</p>

	<h3 id="core-mechanics">Core Mechanics</h3>
<p class="q">If I use an effect that applies to “investigators,” does this include myself?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Unless the effect says “other investigators,” it affects all
investigators, including the one who is using the effect.</p>
	<p class="q">Can an investigator resolve a triggered effect multiple times?</p>
<p class="a">No. A triggered effect is resolved exactly once for each time
it is triggered.</p>
<p>For example, the “Bank Loan” effect triggers exactly once when
an investigator performs the Acquire Assets action. As such, an
investigator would not be able to resolve that effect more than
once to add more than two successes to his test result.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator use an ability that lets him roll
“additional” dice after he’s already rolled for a test?</p>
<p class="a">No. When an investigator resolves a test, he must declare
any additional dice he wish to roll before rolling any dice.</p>
<p class="q">When does the minimum-one-die-on-tests rule apply?</p>
<p class="a">When resolving a test, the investigator, first, calculates his
dice pool. That is, he adds together his skill, Improvements, test
modifier, bonuses, and additional dice. Then he rolls his dice
pool. At this point, if his dice pool is zero or fewer dice, he rolls
one die instead.</p>
<p class="q">What happens if an effect allows an investigator to reroll up to
two dice but he has rolled only one die?</p>
<p class="a">The investigator may use that effect to reroll his single die.
He cannot use that effect to reroll a single die more than once.</p>
<p class="q">Is every roll considered a test?</p>
<p class="a">No. An effect that tells you to roll a specific number of dice,
such as the <span class="reckoning"></span> effect on a Cursed Condition, is not a test. These
rolls cannot be rerolled or modified by effects that affect tests.</p>
<p class="q">Are effects that say “may,” “or,” and “unless” optional?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Effects using the words “may,” “or,” and “unless”
grant the investigator a choice. If an effect says, “may,” the
investigator chooses to resolve that effect or not.</p>
<p>If an effect says, “or,” the investigator chooses one of the effects
separated by the “or.”</p>
<p>If an effect says, “unless,” the investigator may resolve the effect
following “unless.” However, if he chooses not to or is unable to
resolve that effect, he must resolve the effect preceding “unless.”</p>
<p class="q">If an investigator chooses an effect, can that effect be prevented?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. The effect an investigator chooses can be prevented by
another effect. In such a case, the investigator’s choice is not
negated. For example, an investigator must discard his Spell
unless he loses 2 Sanity. If that investigator chooses to lose 2
Sanity, that loss of Sanity can be prevented with the Whiskey
Asset or the Instill Bravery Spell.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator choose not to apply a passive bonus when
resolving a test?</p>
<p class="a">No. A passive bonus, such as “gain +3 <span class="will"></span>,” must be applied
when resolving a test with the indicated skill.</p>
<p>Some bonuses, such as “you may gain +5 <span class="strength"></span> during a Combat
Encounter,” use the word “may.” As such, these bonuses are
optional and do not need to be applied when resolving a test.</p>

<h3 id="investigators">Investigators</h3>
<p class="q">If an investigator uses an effect that applies to “investigators” or
“an investigator,” does that effect include himself?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Unless the effect says “other investigators” or “another
investigator,” it can affect any or all investigators, including the
one who is using the effect.</p>
<p class="q">What happens if a new investigator’s starting possessions are
being used by another investigator?</p>
<p class="a">When a player chooses a new investigator, he receives
that investigator’s starting possessions from the decks,
discard piles, or reserve. If the starting possessions are not
in these places, such as if another investigator or a defeated
investigator has them, the new investigator does not start
with those possessions.</p>
<p class="q">If an investigator has an ability that functions “once per round”
can that ability affect setup?</p>
<p class="a">No. Setup occurs before the first round has begun. As such,
effects with a “once per round” restriction cannot be used
during setup.</p>
<p class="q">When an investigator is defeated, can the newly chosen
investigator be given the Lead Investigator token at the end of
the Mythos Phase?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Both choosing a new investigator and passing the Lead
Investigator token occur “at the end of the Mythos Phase.” The
Lead Investigator chooses the order to resolve effects that occur
at the same time, so a new investigator can be chosen, and then
the Lead Investigator token can be passed to him.</p>
<p class="q">If all investigators are defeated at the same time, do
investigators lose the game?</p>
<p class="a">No. At the end of the Mythos Phase, each defeated
investigator will choose a new investigator to play as. However,
if being defeated would cause a player to be eliminated, such as
if the Ancient One has awoken, all players could be eliminated.
In this case, investigators lose the game.</p>
<p class="q mon">Does reducing my maximum Health reduce my current Health?</p>
<p class="a">No. If your maximum Health is changed, your current
Health remains the same. However, your current Health cannot
exceed your new maximum Health. In such a case, your
current Health is set to your new maximum Health.
The same is true for current and maximum Sanity.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-ones-amp-mysteries">Ancient Ones &amp; Mysteries</h3>
<p class="q">Do effects that “advance the active Mystery” or “solve the active
Mystery” affect the Final Mystery?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Final Mystery is not a Mystery card nor is it
considered the active Mystery. As such, effects that advance or
solve the active Mystery do not affect the Final Mystery.</p>
<p class="q">If the third Mystery would be solved at the end of the Mythos
Phase, but investigators lose the game during the Mythos Phase, is
this the investigators winning and losing at the same time?</p>
<p class="a">No. If investigators lose the game while resolving a Mythos
card, the Mythos Phase has not yet ended, and the third
Mystery is not yet solved.</p>
<p>An example of investigators winning the game and losing
the game at the same time would be if the only remaining
investigator is resolving a Combat Encounter against the
Cthulhu Epic Monster, and his <span class="strength"></span> test result causes both
the Cthulhu Epic Monster and the investigator to be
defeated at the same time.</p>
<p class="q">Against Azathoth, what does the Eldritch token on the
Omen track do?</p>
<p class="a">When the Omen advances to the green space, Doom
advances by one for each Eldritch token on that space. Note
that Eldritch tokens placed on the green space of the Omen
track do not replace that space of the track. This advancement
of Doom is in addition to the advancement for each Gate on
the game board with the green Omen icon.</p>
<p class="q sr">If an investigator discards a Relic Unique Asset as a part of its
flip effect, can he still place an Eldritch token on the Relics of the
Ancient World Mystery?</p>
<p class="a sr">Yes. The Mystery gives the investigator the option to both
place an Eldritch token on the Mystery and discard the ReliC
Unique Asset. The investigator may choose to resolve this effect
even if he can resolve only part of the full effect.</p>
<p class="q">Against Yig, what happens when an investigator is defeated
and Yig has awoken?</p>
<p class="a">Unlike other Ancient Ones, when an investigator is
defeated, that player is not eliminated. The player will selected
a new investigator as if the Ancient One has not awoken.</p>
<p class="q">When playing against Syzygy, do investigators need to solve two
Mysteries to win the game?</p>
<p class="a">No. When the Syzygy Ancient One sheet is flipped, one
Clue will be placed on the Ancient One sheet for each solved
Mystery. However, the Sealing the Portal Special Encounters
will also place Clues on the Ancient One sheet.</p>
<p>Solving the Mysteries is not required to attempt the Special
Encounters or win the game. However, solving Mysteries
greatly reduces the difficulty of the Final Mystery.</p>
<p class="q">If an investigator defeats a Cultist Monster as part of a Spawn
of Abhoth Special Encounter during the Encounter Phase, can he
resolve another encounter?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. If an investigator defeats every Monster on his space
during the Encounter Phase, he may resolve an additional
encounter of his choice.</p>
<p class="q">When resolving a Spawn of Abhoth Special Encounter, can
an investigator benefit from a bonus that applies during a
Combat Encounter?</p>
<p class="a">No. A Spawn of Abhoth Special Encounter is not a Combat
Encounter. As such, bonuses that state “during a Combat
Encounter” do not apply to tests resolved during the Special
Encounter.</p>
<p class="q">When resolving Nephren-Ka’s reckoning effect, if an investigator
is already on The Bent Pyramid, does he lose Sanity?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. The <span class="reckoning"></span> effect on the Nephren-Ka Ancient One sheet
first allows each investigator to move one space toward The
Bent Pyramid. Then each investigator that did not move loses
1 Sanity. Because an investigator on The Bent Pyramid cannot
move closer to the space he occupies, he cannot move and will
lose 1 Sanity.</p>
<p class="q">Does the Spawn of Hastur Epic Monster’s ability prevent it
from losing two or more Health during a Combat Encounter?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. If any effect, including the effects of a Combat
Encounter, would cause the Spawn of Hastur Epic Monster
to lose two or more Health, it loses one Health instead.</p>

<h3 id="possessions-amp-conditions">Possessions &amp; Conditions</h3>
<p class="q">Can an investigator choose to discard a possession he does
not want?</p>
<p class="a">No. An investigator cannot simply discard possessions
he does not want. However, he can trade those possession to
another investigator or discard them if an effect causes him to.</p>
<p class="q">How does the Blunderbuss Asset’s effect work?</p>
<p class="a">Similar to the Double-barreled Shotgun, an investigator
with the Blunderbuss gets two successes for each 6 he rolls
when resolving a <span class="strength"></span> test during a Combat Encounter.</p>
<p>However, for each 1 he rolls during that test he negates one
success. This means that when calculating his total successes,
he subtracts one from the test result for each 1 he rolled to a
minimum of zero successes.</p>
<p class="q">Can the Grotesque Statue Artifact prevent other investigators
from losing Sanity?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Grotesque Statue Artifact’s second effect allows the
investigator to spend one Clue to prevent himself from losing
Sanity from a single effect. It does not allow him to prevent any
other investigator from losing Sanity.</p>
<p class="q">Can the Agency Quarantine Asset or the Shrivelling Spell cause
an Epic Monster to lose Health?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Effects that cause Monsters to lose Health, such as the
Agency Quarantine Asset or the Shriveling Spell, can cause
Epic Monsters to lose Health.</p>
<p class="q mom">Can an investigator have multiple copies of the same
Unique Asset?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. There is no limit to the number of Unique Assets an
investigator can have.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator gain a random Unique Asset when told to
gain a random Asset?</p>
<p class="a">No. If an effect says, “gain 1 random Asset from the deck,”
the investigator gains the Asset from the Asset deck, not the
Unique Asset deck. An investigator gains a Unique Asset only
if the effect specifically calls for a Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q">Can the effects on the front of a double-sided card be used while
the card is facedown?</p>
<p class="a">No. Only the currently showing face of a double-sided card
is relevant. While a double-sided card is facedown, the effects of
its front face are ignored and cannot be used.</p>
<p class="q mom">Can investigators trade Task Assets?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. <span class="trait">Task</span> Assets, like other Assets, may be traded using the
Trade action. If a <span class="trait">Task</span> Asset has one or more tokens on it,
those tokens remain on the card when traded.</p>
<p class="q mom">What happens if an investigator gains a Courier Run Unique
Asset and there are no Clues in the Clue pool that correspond to
City spaces?</p>
<p class="a">The investigator should discard the Clue on the nearest
City space containing a Clue, placing that Clue faceup on his
Courier Run Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q">Does an effect that gives a bonus to <span class="lore"></span> when resolving Spell
effects apply to the <span class="lore"></span> test on the front of the Spell card?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. All text on the Spell card, both front and back, is that
Spell’s effect. As such, when resolving the <span class="lore"></span> test on the front
of the Spell, the investigator adds one bonus to his <span class="lore"></span>.</p>
<p class="q">If an investigator fails to cast the Wither Spell, can he still use
a different Spell or Asset to gain a bonus to his <span class="strength"></span> test during a
Combat Encounter?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Choosing to resolve the Wither Spell does not prohibit
the investigator from using other effects to modify his <span class="strength"></span> test.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator cast the Mists of Releh Spell if there are no
Monsters on his space?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. The Mists of Releh Spell does not require an
investigator to be on a space containing a Monster. However,
that investigator will still suffer any consequences of resolving
the Spell’s effects.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator use the Mists of Releh Spell to encounter
some of the Monsters on his space but not all of them?</p>
<p class="a">No. If an investigator passes the <span class="lore"></span> test of the Mists of
Releh Spell, he chooses an encounter as if there are no Monsters
on his space or encounters all Monsters on his space as normal.</p>
<p class="q">Can the Clairvoyance Spell allows an investigator to ignore
Monsters on his space?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Clairvoyance Spell’s effect allows an investigator
to choose to encounter a Clue on another space. The
investigator is considered to be on that space for all effects
during that encounter.</p>
<p class="q">While casting a Blessing of Isis or Plumb the Void Spell, when
is the investigator chosen?</p>
<p class="a">When resolving the effects of a Blessing of Isis Spell or
a Plumb the Void Spell, you choose an investigator before
resolving the <span class="lore"></span> test. This choice is made regardless of the
success or failure of the test.</p>
<p class="q mom">Can an investigator benefit from both the Storm of Spirits Spell
and a Weapon Asset?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Storm of Spirits Spell allows an investigator to
resolve a <span class="lore"></span> test in place of the <span class="strength"></span> test during a Combat
Encounter. If he does, bonuses to his <span class="strength"></span> do not apply to
the <span class="lore"></span> test. However, bonuses to the investigator’s <span class="lore"></span> apply
to the test.</p>
<p class="q">If an investigator gains a Condition during a Rest action,
can he resolve a “when you perform a Rest action” effect of
that Condition?</p>
<p class="a">No. All effects that trigger “when you perform a Rest
action” trigger at the same time as the investigator performs
that action. Any Conditions he gains thereafter will not trigger
until the next time he performs a Rest action.</p>
<p class="q fl">Can an investigator with a Lost in Time and Space Condition
be moved by another investigator using the Plumb the Void Spell?</p>
<p class="a">No. If an effect states that an investigator cannot move,
such as a Lost in Time and Space Condition or a Detained
Condition, that investigator cannot move on his own nor can
he be moved by any effect.</p>
<p class="q mom">When can an investigator discard a Debt Condition with a
Funding Condition?</p>
<p class="a">If an investigator would gain a Debt Condition and he
already has a Funding Condition, he may discard the Funding
Condition instead of gaining the Debt Condition.</p>
<p>If an investigator has both a Debt Condition and a Funding
Condition, he may discard both cards at any time so long as the
effect of neither Condition is currently being resolved.</p>
<p>For instance, a Mythos card instructs investigators to resolve <span class="reckoning"></span>
effects; an investigator may choose to discard both Conditions
before resolving the <span class="reckoning"></span> effect of either Condition, but he
cannot begin resolving his Debt Condition, decide he doesn’t
like what he sees, and then discard both Conditions before
finishing the effect.</p>
<p class="q">Does an investigator recover additional Health and Sanity from
effects, such as the Healing Words Spell or Provisions Unique Asset,
if he has a Condition that restricts him from recovering Health or
Sanity during a Rest action?</p>
<p class="a">No. An investigator with a Condition that restricts
him from recovering Health or Sanity, such as Poisoned or
Hypothermia, cannot recover Health or Sanity from a Rest
action including additional Health and Sanity from other
effects during a Rest action.</p>
<p>However, effects that cause an investigator to recover Health
or Sanity without performing a Rest action, such as the Private
Care Asset, affect that investigator as normal.</p>
<p class="q sr">When an investigator moves to another space using the Kopesh
of the Abyss Artifact’s effect, does that investigator encounter the
Monsters on his new space?</p>
<p class="a">No. The investigator will encounter each Monster on his
space. Then, if he defeats all Monsters on his space, he may
move to the nearest space containing a Monster. He will not
encounter the Monsters on his new space nor will he resolve an
additional encounter. If he remains on that space until the next
Encounter Phase, he will then encounter each Monster on that
space as normal.</p>
<p class="q">Can the Crystal of the Elder Things Artifact negate Health loss
that cannot be prevented?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. An investigator with the Crystal of the Elder Things
Artifact cannot lose Health or Sanity from Mythos card text
effects even if that Health or Sanity loss cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>The Crystal does not create a prevention effect that “prevents”
the loss of Health or Sanity if it would occur. Instead, it
prohibits Mythos card text effects from causing the
investigator to lose Health or Sanity.</p>
<p class="q">If an investigator with a Know Thy Enemy Unique Asset gains
more than one Clue during a Research Encounter, can he place
multiple Eldritch tokens on his task?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. An investigator places one Eldritch token on a Know
Thy Enemy Unique Asset for each Clue he gains as part of a
Research Encounter.</p>
<p>However, Clues gained from other effects, such as Mandy
Thompson’s passive ability, are not gained as part of the
Research Encounter and do not allow the investigator to place
an Eldritch token on the Know Thy Enemy Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q">What happens if an investigator gains a Treasure Map Unique
Asset and there are no Clues in the Clue pool?</p>
<p class="a">The investigator should discard the Clue on the nearest
space containing a Clue, placing that Clue faceup on his
Treasure Map Unique Asset.</p>
<p class="q mon">Are the Eldritch tokens gained from a Corruption Condition
discarded when I discard the Condition?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Corruption Condition (and some other effects)
cause you to gain Eldritch tokens which are placed on your
Investigator sheet. Eldritch tokens you have gained are not
discarded unless an effect specifically allows you to spend
or discard them.</p>

<h3 id="actions-amp-delayed">Actions &amp; Delayed</h3>
<p class="q">Can an investigator’s “additional” action be used to perform an
action he has already performed in that round?</p>
<p class="a">No. An investigator may perform an action only once
each round, even if he is able to perform an additional action,
such as from the Ruby of R’lyeh Artifact or Charlie Kane’s
action ability.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator be Delayed more than once?</p>
<p class="a">No. Becoming Delayed while already Delayed has no effect.
An investigator cannot choose to become Delayed to pay for an
effect if he is already Delayed.</p>
<p class="q">What happens if an investigator becomes Delayed during
his action?</p>
<p class="a">If an investigator becomes Delayed during the Action Phase,
he immediately ends his current action, loses any remaining
actions, and ends his turn instead. If the investigator has no
actions remaining to lose, he will not become Delayed, and he
will be able to perform actions in the next round.</p>
<p class="q">If the Lead Investigator or investigators as a group choose an
investigator to become Delayed, can that investigator negate that
effect with the Pocket Watch Asset?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. The Pocket Watch Asset or Mark Harrigan’s passive
ability prevents the investigator from becoming Delayed unless
he chooses to become Delayed to pay for an effect. In this case,
there is a choice involved, but that choice does not pay for an
effect. This remains true regardless of that investigator’s role in
the decision making process and even if the Lead Investigator is
Mark Harrigan or the investigator with the Pocket Watch Asset
and he chooses himself.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator resolve effects with a “during the Action
Phase” restriction if she is Delayed?</p>
<p class="a">No. Effects that state “during the Action Phase” can be
resolved before or after performing an action. An investigator
who begins the Action Phase Delayed, rights her Investigator
token but does not perform any actions. As such, she does not
have an opportunity to resolve effects that state “during the
Action Phase.”</p>
<p class="q">Does the Trade action cause an investigator to “gain” the
possessions given to her?</p>
<p class="a">No. As part of the Trade action, both investigators may give
any number of their possessions to one another. However, none
of the exchanged possessions were gained as part of the action.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator use a component action multiple times if
he has access to multiple copies of the same component?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. An investigator may use each component action he has
access to up to once per round.</p>
<p>For example, an investigator could perform the component
local action of a Detained Condition of another investigator on
his space as his first action; then perform the same component
local action of a third investigator’s Detained Condition as his
second action.</p>
<p>Similarly, if an investigator has two copies of the Dog Sled
Unique Asset, he could use the component action of both of
those Unique Assets during the same round.</p>

<h3 id="encounters-amp-combat">Encounters &amp; Combat</h3>
<p class="q">Can an investigator resolve an “as an encounter” effect if there
is a Monster on his space?</p>
<p class="a">No. Effects that say “as an encounter” are treated just
like any other encounter option available. The investigator
must encounter all Monsters on his space. Then, if there are
no Monsters on his space, he may resolve that effect as his
additional encounter.</p>
<p>If an effect says “instead of resolving an encounter,” such as
the Detained Condition, this can be resolved even on a space
containing a Monster.</p>
<p class="q">Why do some Research Encounter not give the investigator
the Clue?</p>
<p class="a">Some Research Encounters do not allow the investigator to
“gain this Clue.” However, these encounters often feature other
beneficial effects for the investigator, such as gaining an Artifact
or retreating Doom.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator use multiple weapons during combat?</p>
<p class="a">An investigator can apply only a single bonus to a
test. However, he may use any other effects from his other
possessions. For example, if an investigator has a Bull Whip
Asset and a .45 Automatic Asset, he may apply the +3 bonus
from the .45 to his <span class="strength"></span> instead of the +1 bonus from the whip,
and he may reroll one die by using the whip’s other effect.</p>
<p class="q">What effects are negated by Physical Resistance and Magical
Resistance?</p>
<p class="a">When resolving a Combat Encounter against a Monster
with <a href="#physical-resistance">Physical Resistance</a> or <a href="#magical-resistance">Magical Resistance</a>, an investigator
cannot apply bonuses to his dice pool.</p>
<p>Bonuses are effects on cards or other components that grant
extra dice when testing a skill. Bonuses are always written with
the following format: “Gain +X Skill” where X is the number of
dice and Skill is the affected skill. For example, the .38 Revolver
Asset says, “Gain +2 <span class="strength"></span> ...”</p>
<p>Any other effects that allow rerolls (such as the Lucky Rabbit’s
Foot Asset), dice manipulation (such as the Lucky Cigarette
Case Asset), or “additional dice” (such as Jim Culver’s and
Agnes Baker’s passive abilities) still apply.</p>
<p class="q">Does Physical Resistance or Magical Resistance restrict an
investigator from using the Storm of Spirits Spell, Shriveling Spell,
or Banishment Spell?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Storm of Spirits Spell allows an investigator to
test <span class="lore"></span> in place of <span class="strength"></span> during Combat Encounters. This is not
a bonus, and as such, it is unaffected by Magical Resistance
or Physical Resistance. Similarly, the Shriveling Spell and
Banishment Spell do not apply a bonus during a Combat
Encounter, so they are unaffected by Magical Resistance or
Physical Resistance.</p>

<h3 id="mythos-gates-amp-monsters">Mythos, Gates &amp; Monsters</h3>
<p class="q">If a Mythos card’s effect causes another Mythos card to be
resolved, should that Mythos card’s icons be resolved as well?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. When resolving a Mythos card, all elements of the
card must be resolved if possible. If a Mythos card’s effect
is to resolve an additional Mythos card, all elements of that
additional card must also be resolved.</p>
<p class="q">Is closing a Gate and discarding it the same thing?</p>
<p class="a">No. Although closing a Gate does cause it to be discarded,
discarding a Gate is not considered closing it. For example,
if an effect would discard a Gate while the Mysterious Lights
Mythos card is in play, that effect is still resolved, discarding the
Gate, even though “Gates cannot be closed.”</p>
<p class="q">When is a Monster’s spawn effect resolved?</p>
<p class="a">When a Monster is spawned, it’s “When this Monster is
spawned” effect is resolved immediately as part of the effect
that spawned it.</p>
<p class="q">If a Monster’s or Epic Monster’s toughness is reduced to zero, is
that Monster defeated?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. A Monster or Epic Monster is defeated if it has lost
Health equal to or greater than its toughness. If a Monster’s
toughness is reduced to zero, it is defeated. Even if it has not
lost any Health, zero lost Health is equal to zero toughness.</p>
<p class="q">What happens if an effect would cause the Omen to advance to
the red space while it is already on that space?</p>
<p class="a">“Advance the Omen to the red space of the Omen track”
means to advance the Omen until it is on the red space. If the
Omen starts on the red space, it will advance four times in total
and return to the red space of the Omen track.</p>
<p>If Syzygy is the Ancient One, this will trigger its “When the
Omen advances to the red space of the Omen track” effect.</p>
<p class="q">What happens to Gates in the Gate stack after they are
revealed?</p>
<p class="a">Revealed Gates remain where they are in the Gate stack
unless the effect that causes the Gates to be revealed states
otherwise. The Gate stack is not randomized nor are the Gates
discarded or otherwise moved in the Gate stack.</p>
<p>After a Gate in the Gate stack has been revealed, it remains
revealed until it is removed from the Gate stack or the Gate
stack is randomized.</p>

<h3 id="preludes">Preludes</h3>
<p class="q">If Doom starts on a space containing an Eldritch token placed
by the “Apocalypse Nigh” Prelude, do you resolve a Disaster?</p>
<p class="a">No. The Prelude states that a Disaster is resolved only when
Doom advances to a space containing an Eldritch token. Doom
must advance for the effect to trigger.</p>

<h3 id="spaces-amp-paths">Spaces &amp; Paths</h3>
<p class="q mom">What space type are spaces on the Antarctica side board?</p>
<p class="a">The spaces on the Antarctica side board do not have a
space type. When an investigator encounters a Clue on the
Antarctica side board, he draws and resolves an Antarctica
Research Encounter.</p>
<p class="q mom">Are two spaces connected by a Local path adjacent?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Two spaces connected by a Local path are adjacent.</p>
<p class="q">Do paths leading off the side of the game board connect to the
opposite side of the game board?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Paths that lead off the side of the game board connect
to the corresponding paths on the opposite side of the game
board. For example, Tokyo and space 2 are adjacent, connected
by a Ship path.</p>
<p class="q">Can there be multiple Clues on a space?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Some effects move Clues to other spaces or spawn
Clues on specific spaces. There is no limit to the number
of Clues that can be on a space. However, each Clue is
encountered separately.</p>
<p class="q">Can an investigator interrupt part of his action to move along
a Local path?</p>
<p class="a">Yes. Once per round, during the Action Phase, an
investigator may move along any number of interconnected
Local paths. This movement can be resolved before, after, or
during any action the investigator performs.</p>
<p class="q">Are devastated cities still “named city spaces”?</p>
<p class="a">Devastated spaces are no longer City spaces; they have no
space type. However, a devastated space does retain its name.</p>
<p>An effect that refers to a “named City space” means a space
that is both a City space and a named space. As such, a
devastated space is not a named City space because it is
no longer a City space.</p>
